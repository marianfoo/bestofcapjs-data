At the same time, the same `mtar` can be used for subsequent PostgreSQL deployments (with schema evolution).\n\nTwo major steps in addition to enabling the schema evolution are included in this `mtar`.\n\n1. create local folder `deployer` (any name works)\n2. in `deployer`, create a `package.json` containing\n\n  ```json\n  ...\n  \"//npm run migrate\": \"only one-time!\",\n  \"migrate\": \"cds deploy --model-only\",\n  \"//npm run deploy\": \"subsequent deployments\",\n  \"deploy\": \"cds deploy\"\n  ...\n  ```\n\n3. add a section to your `/mta.yaml` denoting the `deployer` directory as a standalone application that runs one-time\n\n```yaml\n- name: pg-db-deployer\n    type: custom\n    path: deployer\n    parameters:\n      buildpacks: nodejs_buildpack\n      no-route: true\n      no-start: true\n      disk-quota: 2GB\n      memory: 512MB\n      tasks:\n      - name: migrate\n        command: npm run migrate\n      # # for subsequent deployments\n      # - name: deploy\n      #  command: npm run deploy\n        disk-quota: 2GB\n        memory: 512MB\n    build-parameters:\n      before-all:\n        custom: \n        - npm i\n        # generate the \"csn-snapshot\" - only necessary for one-time migration,\n        # can be commented out on subsequent deployments\n        - cds compile '*' -2 json > deployer/schema.csn\n      ignore: [\"node_modules/\"]\n    requires:\n      - name: pg-database\n\nresources:\n  - name: pg-database\n    parameters:\n      path: ./pg-options.json\n      service: postgresql-db\n      service-plan: trial # change to yours!\n      skip-service-updates:\n        parameters: true\n      service-tags:\n        - plain\n    type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service\n```\n\n## migration points to consider\n\n### mixed-case identifiers\n\neven though column names that are not double-quoted are folded to lowercase in PostgreSQL (`yourName` -> `yourname`, `\"yourName\"` -> `yourName`),  \nyou can use the mixed case definitions from your `.cds` files to reference them.  \n\nexample: `brewery_id` on DB level -> `brewery_ID` on CDS level\n\nformerly w/ `cds-pg` you had to follow the DB level: `SELECT.from(Beers).columns('brewery_id').groupBy('brewery_id')`  \nnow, re-use the CDS definitions: `SELECT.from(Beers).columns('brewery_ID').groupBy('brewery_ID')`\n\nSo please adjust your `CQL` statements accordingly.\n\n### timezones (potential _**BREAKING CHANGE**_)\n\nany date- + time-type will get stored in [`UTC`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) **without any timezone identifier in the actual data field**.  \nCAP's inbound- and outbound adapters take care of converting incoming and outgoing data from/to the desired time zones.  \nSo when a `dateime` comes in being in [an ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) compatible format  \n  `2009-01-01T15:00:00+01:00` (15:00:00 on January 1 2009 in Vienna (CEST))  \nwill get stored as  \n  `2009-01-01T13:00:00` (13:00:00 on January 1 2009 in UTC).\n\nPlease be aware of that concept and rely on the client to parse UTC in your desired timezone (format).\n\n### `cds.DatabaseService` consumption\n\n`InsertResult` now does only return the affected rows and their `ID`s.\n\n```js\nconst entries = [\n  { name: 'Beer1', /* ... */ },\n  { name: 'Beer2', /* ... */ },\n  { name: 'Beer3', /* ... */ }\n]\nconst insertResult = await cds.run(INSERT.into(Beers).entries(entries))\nexpect(insertResult.affectedRows).to.equal(3)\nconst beers = [...insertResult] //> this calls the [Symbol.iterator] method of the insert result\n// beers:\n// [ \n//   { ID: \"f81d7ee5-922b-48a1-a12a-a899b8594c99\" }, \n//   { ID: \"ddda7f8e-e26b-430f-a80c-ac2c7df29510\" },\n//   { ID: \"7228c40f-0046-4f53-8a2b-3d55ad825f59\" }\n// ]\n```\n\nIn `cds-pg`, we additionally surfaced the entire inserted dataset.\n\n```js\n// continuing after the insert of the above example:\n// const insertResult = await cds.run(INSERT.into(Beers).entries(entries))\n\n// this works NO MORE - see above\nconst beers = insertResult.results\nexpect(beers.length).toStrictEqual(3)\nexpect(beers[0].ID).toMatch(uuidRegex)\nexpect(beers[0].createdAt.toISOString()).toMatch(timestampRegex)\nexpect(beers[0].modifiedAt.toISOString()).toMatch(timestampRegex)\n```\n\nSo please adjust your runtime coding accordingly.\n",

Feel free to use it, open issues, contribute, and help answering questions.\n\nThe `cds-plugin-ui5` is a CDS server `cds-plugin` which enables the integration of UI5 tooling based (UI5 freestyle or Fiori elements) projects into the CDS server via the UI5 tooling express middlewares. The UI5 or Fiori elements projects just need to be located in the `app` folder of the CDS server, or via the `cds.env.folders.app` variable, or be a dependency of the CDS server.\n\n> :construction: **Note**\n> This cds-plugin is still work in progress and not final yet!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThe plugin requires [`@sap/cds`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds) `>=6.8.2`.\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd a `devDependency` to the `cds-plugin-ui5` to your CDS server project:\n\n```sh\nnpm add cds-plugin-ui5 -D\n```\n\nThat's it!\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe plugin accepts configuration to control the mount path for the embedding into the CDS server and selected configuration options for the UI5 server middlewares which are embedded into the mount path of the CDS server.\n\n#### Mount Path\n\nThe mount path of the UI5 application configures the nested Router for the UI5 server middlewares to run under this predefined path. It is by default derived from the `metadata/name` of the `ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nspecVersion: \"3.0\"\nmetadata:\n  name: ui5.bookshop\ntype: application\n```\n\nThis configuration can be overruled by adding a the `customConfiguration/cds-plugin-ui5/mountPath` option into the `ui5.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\nspecVersion: \"3.0\"\nmetadata:\n  name: ui5.bookshop\ntype: application\ncustomConfiguration:\n  cds-plugin-ui5:\n    mountPath: /bookshop\n```\n\nIn some cases it is necessary to overrule the UI5 application local configuration in the CDS server. Therefore, you can add custom configuration into the `package.json` of the CDS server into the section: `cds/cds-plugin-ui5/modules/%moduleId%/mountPath`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"cds-bookshop\",\n  [...]\n  \"cds\": {\n    [...]\n    \"cds-plugin-ui5\": {\n      \"modules\": {\n        \"ui5-bookshop\": {\n          \"mountPath\": \"/the-bookshop\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `moduleId` is either the directory name for local apps in the `app` directory of the CDS server or for dependencies the `name` from the `package.json`.\n\nThe configuration can also be injected with the environment variable `CDS_PLUGIN_UI5_MODULES`. It contains the JSON string from the configuration above, e.g.:\n\n```sh\nCDS_PLUGIN_UI5_MODULES=\"{ \\\"ui5-bookshop\\\": { \\\"mountPath\\\": \\\"/the-bookshop\\\" } }\" cds-serve\n```\n\n#### UI5 Server Middlewares\n\nIf you require to configure the UI5 server middlewares, you can do so by adding some selected configuration options in the `package.json` of the CDS server in the section: `cds/cds-plugin-ui5/modules/%moduleId%`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"cds-bookshop\",\n  [...]\n  \"cds\": {\n    [...]\n    \"cds-plugin-ui5\": {\n      \"modules\": {\n        \"ui5-bookshop\": {\n          \"configFile\": \"ui5.yaml\",\n          \"workspaceConfigFile\": \"ui5-workspace.yaml\",\n          \"workspaceName\": \"default\",\n          \"versionOverride\": \"1.117.0\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `moduleId` is either the directory name for local apps in the `app` directory of the CDS server or for dependencies the `name` from the `package.json`.\n\nThe available configuration options are:\n\n* `configFile`: *`string`* - name of the config file (defaults to \"ui5.yaml\")\n* `workspaceConfigFile`: *`string`* - name of the workspace config file (defaults to \"ui5-workspace.yaml\")\n* `workspaceName`: *`string`* - name of the workspace (defaults to \"default\" when the file at workspaceConfigPath exists)\n* `versionOverride`: *`string`* - Framework version to use instead of the one defined in the root project\n\nIf the `configFile` or `workspaceConfigFile` startes with `./` or `../` then the config file is considered to be relative to the `package.json`.\n\nThe configuration can also be injected with the environment variable `CDS_PLUGIN_UI5_MODULES`. It contains the JSON string from the configuration above, e.g.:\n\n```sh\nCDS_PLUGIN_UI5_MODULES=\"{ \\\"ui5-bookshop\\\": { \\\"configFile\\\": \\\"ui5-dist.yaml\\\" } }\" cds-serve\n```\n\nThe configuration options from the UI5 server middlewares and the mount path can be mixed together as they both are in the same section of the `package.json`.\n\n## Info for UI5 Tooling Extension Developers\n\nCustom middlewares may generate virtual app pages which should also be listed as web applications in the welcome page of the `@sap/cds` server. This is possible by assigning a static `getAppPages` function to the middleware function. The following snippet show-cases how this can be done:\n\n```js\n// the middleware factory function\nmodule.exports = async ({ log, resources, options }) => {\n  // create the middleware function\n  const mwFn = (req, res, next) => {\n    [...]\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * Returns an array of app pages to be added to the welcome\n   * page of the <code>@sap/cds</code> server.\n   * @returns {undefined|string[]} array of app pages\n   */\n  mwFn.getAppPages = function() {\n    return [\"/test.html\"];\n  };\n\n  // finally return the middleware function\n  return mwFn;\n};\n```\n\nThe returned app pages will be added to the welcome page within the respective mount path.\n\n## Hints\n\nThis section includes hints for the usage of the `cds-plugin-ui5` with other tools.\n\n### JEST\n\nThe `cds-plugin-ui5` doesn't work with JEST out of the box as it internally is using dynamic imports to load helpers from the UI5 tooling. JEST fails with a `segmentation fault` error and therefore, the `cds-plugin-ui5` is disabled when running in context of JEST. It can be forcefully enabled by setting the environment variable `CDS_PLUGIN_UI5_ACTIVE=true`. But in this case you need to at least use Node.js 21 (https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/35889) and you need to enable the experimental support for ES modules (https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules). This enables the `cds-plugin-ui5` to run in context of JEST.\n\n## Support\n\nPlease use the GitHub bug tracking system to post questions, bug reports or to create pull requests.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny type of contribution (code contributions, pull requests, issues) to this set of tooling extensions will be equally appreciated.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](../../LICENSE) under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware License.

[Et voilà:](#change-history-view)\n\n<img width=\"1300\" alt=\"change-history-loading\" src=\"_assets/change-history.gif\">\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n- [Change Tracking Plugin for SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](#change-tracking-plugin-for-sap-cloud-application-programming-model-cap)\n  - [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\n  - [Preliminaries](#preliminaries)\n  - [Setup](#setup)\n  - [Annotations](#annotations)\n    - [Human-readable Types and Fields](#human-readable-types-and-fields)\n    - [Human-readable IDs](#human-readable-ids)\n    - [Human-readable Values](#human-readable-values)\n  - [Test-drive locally](#test-drive-locally)\n  - [Change History View](#change-history-view)\n  - [Customizations](#customizations)\n    - [Altered table view](#altered-table-view)\n    - [Disable lazy loading](#disable-lazy-loading)\n    - [Disable UI Facet generation](#disable-ui-facet-generation)\n    - [Disable Association to Changes Generation](#disable-association-to-changes-generation)\n  - [Modelling Samples](#modelling-samples)\n    - [Specify Object ID](#specify-object-id)\n    - [Tracing Changes](#tracing-changes)\n    - [Don'ts](#donts)\n  - [Contributing](#contributing)\n  - [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n  - [Licensing](#licensing)\n\n## Preliminaries\n\nIn this guide, we use the [Incidents Management reference sample app](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app) as the base to add change tracking to. Clone the repository and apply the step-by-step instructions:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app\ncd incidents-app\nnpm i\n```\n\n**Alternatively**, you can clone the incidents app including the prepared enhancements for change-tracking:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/cap-js/calesi --recursive\ncd calesi\nnpm i\n```\n\n```sh\ncds w samples/change-tracking\n```\n\n## Setup\n\nTo enable change tracking, simply add this self-configuring plugin package to your project:\n\n```sh\nnpm add @cap-js/change-tracking\n```\n\n## Annotations\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please be aware that [**sensitive** or **personal** data](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy/annotations#annotating-personal-data) should not be change tracked, since viewing the log allows users to circumvent [audit-logging](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy/audit-logging#setup).\n\nAll we need to do is to identify what should be change-tracked by annotating respective entities and elements in our model with the `@changelog` annotation. Following the [best practice of separation of concerns](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/domain-modeling#separation-of-concerns), we do so in a separate file _srv/change-tracking.cds_:\n\n```cds\nusing { ProcessorService } from './processor-service';\n\nannotate ProcessorService.Incidents {\n  customer @changelog: [customer.name];\n  title    @changelog;\n  status   @changelog;\n}\n\nannotate ProcessorService.Conversations with @changelog: [author, timestamp] {\n  message  @changelog @Common.Label: 'Message';\n}\n```\n\nThe minimal annotation we require for change tracking is `@changelog` on elements, as for the elements `title` and `status` in the sample snippet above.\n\nAdditional identifiers or labels can be added to obtain more *human-readable* change records as described below.\n\n### Human-readable Types and Fields\n\nBy default the implementation looks up *Object Type* names or *Field* namesfrom respective  `@title` or  `@Common.Label` annotations, and applies i18n lookups. If no such annotations are given, the technical names of the respective CDS definitions are displayed.\n\nFor example, without the `@title` annotation, changes to conversation entries would show up with the technical entity name:\n\n<img width=\"1300\" alt=\"change-history-type\" src=\"_assets/changes-type-wbox.png\">\n\nWith an annotation, and possible i18n translations like so:\n\n```cds\nannotate Conversations with @title: 'Conversations';\n```\n\nWe get a human-readable display for *Object Type*:\n\n<img width=\"1300\" alt=\"change-history-type-hr\" src=\"_assets/changes-type-hr-wbox.png\">\n\n### Human-readable IDs\n\nThe changelog annotations for *Object ID* are defined at entity level.\n\nThese are already human-readable by default, unless the `@changelog` definition cannot be uniquely mapped such as types `enum` or `Association`.\n\nFor example, having a `@changelog` annotation without any additional identifiers, changes to conversation entries would show up as simple entity IDs:\n\n```cds\nannotate ProcessorService.Conversations {\n```\n\n<img width=\"1300\" alt=\"change-history-id\" src=\"_assets/changes-id-wbox.png\">\n\nHowever, this is not advisable as we cannot easily distinguish between changes. It is more appropriate to annotate as follows:\n\n```cds\nannotate ProcessorService.Conversations with @changelog: [author, timestamp] {\n```\n\n<img width=\"1300\" alt=\"change-history-id-hr\" src=\"_assets/changes-id-hr-wbox.png\">\n\nExpanding the changelog annotation by additional identifiers `[author, timestamp]`, we can now better identify the `message` change events by their respective author and timestamp.\n\n### Human-readable Values\n\nThe changelog annotations for *New Value* and *Old Value* are defined at element level.\n\nThey are already human-readable by default, unless the `@changelog` definition cannot be uniquely mapped such as types `enum` or `Association`.\n\nFor example, having a `@changelog` annotation without any additional identifiers, changes to incident customer would show up as UUIDs:\n\n```cds\ncustomer @changelog;\n```\n\n<img width=\"1300\" alt=\"change-history-value\" src=\"_assets/changes-value-wbox.png\">\n\nHence, here it is essential to add a unique identifier to obtain human-readable value columns:\n\n```cds\ncustomer @changelog: [customer.name];\n```\n\n<img width=\"1300\" alt=\"change-history-value-hr\" src=\"_assets/changes-value-hr-wbox.png\">\n\n## Test-drive locally\n\nWith the steps above, we have successfully set up change tracking for our reference application. Let's see that in action.\n\n1. **Start the server**:\n\n```sh\ncds watch\n```\n\n2. **Make a change** on your change-tracked elements. This change will automatically be persisted in the database table (`sap.changelog.ChangeLog`) and made available in a pre-defined view, namely the [Change History view](#change-history-view) for your convenience.\n\n## Change History View\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> To ensure proper lazy loading of the Change History table, please use **SAPUI5 version 1.120.0** or higher.<br>\n> If you wish to *disable* this feature, please see the customization section on how to [disable lazy loading](#disable-lazy-loading).\n\n<img width=\"1300\" alt=\"change-history\" src=\"_assets/changes.png\">\n\nIf you have a Fiori Element application, the CDS plugin automatically provides and generates a view `sap.changelog.ChangeView`, the facet of which is automatically added to the Fiori Object Page of your change-tracked entities/elements. In the UI, this corresponds to the *Change History* table which serves to help you to view and search the stored change records of your modeled entities.\n\n## Customizations\n\n### Altered table view\n\nThe *Change History* view can be easily adapted and configured to your own needs by simply changing or extending it. For example, let's assume we only want to show the first 5 columns in equal spacing, we would extend `srv/change-tracking.cds` as follows:\n\n```cds\nusing from '@cap-js/change-tracking';\n\nannotate sap.changelog.ChangeView with @(\n  UI.LineItem : [\n    { Value: modification, @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},\n    { Value: createdAt,    @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},\n    { Value: createdBy,    @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},\n    { Value: entity,       @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }},\n    { Value: objectID,     @HTML5.CssDefaults: { width:'20%' }}\n  ]\n);\n```\n\nIn the UI, the *Change History* table now contains 5 equally-spaced columns with the desired properties:\n\n<img width=\"1300\" alt=\"change-history-custom\" src=\"_assets/changes-custom.png\">\n\nFor more information and examples on adding Fiori Annotations, see [Adding SAP Fiori Annotations](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/fiori#fiori-annotations).\n\n### Disable lazy loading\n\nTo disable the lazy loading feature of the *Change History* table, you can add the following annotation to your `srv/change-tracking.cds`:\n\n```cds\nusing from '@cap-js/change-tracking';\n\nannotate sap.changelog.aspect @(UI.Facets: [{\n  $Type : 'UI.ReferenceFacet',\n  ID    : 'ChangeHistoryFacet',\n  Label : '{i18n>ChangeHistory}',\n  Target: 'changes/@UI.PresentationVariant',\n  ![@UI.PartOfPreview]\n}]);\n```\n\nThe system now uses the SAPUI5 default setting `![@UI.PartOfPreview]: true`, such that the table will always shown when navigating to that respective Object page.\n\n### Disable UI Facet generation\n\nIf you do not want the UI facet added to a specific UI, you can annotate the service entity with `@changelog.disable_facet`. This will disable the automatic addition of the UI faced to this specific entity, but also all views or further projections up the chain.\n\n### Disable Association to Changes Generation\n\nFor some scenarios, e.g. when doing `UNION` and the `@changelog` annotion is still propageted, the automatic addition of the association to `changes` does not make sense. You can use `@changelog.disable_assoc`for this to be disabled on entity level.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> This will also supress the addition of the UI facet, since the change-view is not available as target entity anymore.\n\n## Modelling Samples\n\nThis chapter describes more modelling cases for further reference, from simple to complex, including but not limited to the followings.\n\n### Specify Object ID\n\nUse cases for Object ID annotation\n\n#### Use Case 1: Annotate single field/multiple fields of associated table(s) as the Object ID\n\nModelling in `db/schema.cds`\n\n```cds\nentity Incidents : cuid, managed {\n  ...\n  customer       : Association to Customers;\n  title          : String @title: 'Title';\n  urgency        : Association to Urgency default 'M';\n  status         : Association to Status default 'N';\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAdd the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`\n\n```cds\nannotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [customer.name, urgency.code, status.criticality] {\n  title    @changelog;\n}\n```\n\n![AssociationID](_assets/AssociationID.png)\n\n#### Use Case 2: Annotate single field/multiple fields of project customized types as the Object ID\n\nModelling in `db/schema.cds`\n\n```cds\nentity Incidents : cuid, managed {\n  ...\n  customer       : Association to Customers;\n  title          : String @title: 'Title';\n  ...\n}\n\nentity Customers : cuid, managed {\n  ...\n  email          : EMailAddress;  // customized type\n  phone          : PhoneNumber;   // customized type\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAdd the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`\n\n```cds\nannotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [customer.email, customer.phone] {\n  title    @changelog;\n}\n```\n\n![CustomTypeID](_assets/CustomTypeID.png)\n\n#### Use Case 3: Annotate chained associated entities from the current entity as the Object ID\n\nModelling in `db/schema.cds`\n\n```cds\nentity Incidents : cuid, managed {\n  ...\n  customer       : Association to Customers;\n  ...\n}\n\nentity Customers : cuid, managed {\n  ...\n  addresses : Association to Addresses;\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAdd the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`\n\n```cds\nannotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [customer.addresses.city, customer.addresses.postCode] {\n  title    @changelog;\n}\n```\n\n![ChainedAssociationID](_assets/ChainedAssociationID.png)\n\n> Change-tracking supports annotating chained associated entities from the current entity as object ID of current entity in case the entity in consumer applications is a pure relation table. However, the usage of chained associated entities is not recommended due to performance cost.\n\n### Tracing Changes\n\nUse cases for tracing changes\n\n#### Use Case 1: Trace the changes of child nodes from the current entity and display the meaningful data from child nodes (composition relation)\n\nModelling in `db/schema.cds`\n\n```cds\nentity Incidents : managed, cuid {\n  ...\n  title          : String @title: 'Title';\n  conversation   : Composition of many Conversation;\n  ...\n}\n\naspect Conversation: managed, cuid {\n    ...\n    message   : String;\n}\n```\n\nAdd the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`\n\n```cds\nannotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [title] {\n  conversation @changelog: [conversation.message];\n}\n```\n\n![CompositionChange](_assets/CompositionChange.png)\n\n#### Use Case 2: Trace the changes of associated entities from the current entity and display the meaningful data from associated entities (association relation)\n\nModelling in `db/schema.cds`\n\n```cds\nentity Incidents : cuid, managed {\n  ...\n  customer       : Association to Customers;\n  title          : String @title: 'Title';\n  ...\n}\n\nentity Customers : cuid, managed {\n  ...\n  email          : EMailAddress;\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAdd the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`\n\n```cds\nannotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [title] {\n  customer @changelog: [customer.email];\n}\n```\n\n![AssociationChange](_assets/AssociationChange.png)\n\n#### Use Case 3: Trace the changes of fields defined by project customized types and display the meaningful data\n\nModelling in `db/schema.cds`\n\n```cds\ntype StatusType : Association to Status;\n\nentity Incidents : cuid, managed {\n  ...\n  title          : String @title: 'Title';\n  status         : StatusType default 'N';\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAdd the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`\n\n```cds\nannotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [title] {\n  status   @changelog: [status.code];\n}\n```\n\n![CustomTypeChange](_assets/CustomTypeChange.png)\n\n#### Use Case 4: Trace the changes of chained associated entities from the current entity and display the meaningful data from associated entities (association relation)\n\nModelling in `db/schema.cds`\n\n```cds\nentity Incidents : cuid, managed {\n  ...\n  title          : String @title: 'Title';\n  customer       : Association to Customers;\n  ...\n}\n\nentity Customers : cuid, managed {\n  ...\n  addresses : Association to Addresses;\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAdd the following `@changelog` annotations in `srv/change-tracking.cds`\n\n```cds\nannotate ProcessorService.Incidents with @changelog: [title] {\n  customer @changelog: [customer.addresses.city, customer.addresses.streetAddress];\n}\n```\n\n![ChainedAssociationChange](_assets/ChainedAssociationChange.png)\n\n> Change-tracking supports analyzing chained associated entities from the current entity in case the entity in consumer applications is a pure relation table. However, the usage of chained associated entities is not recommended due to performance cost.\n\n#### Use Case 5: Trace the changes of union entity and display the meaningful data\n\n`Payable.cds`:\n\n```cds\nentity Payables : cuid {\n    displayId    : String;\n    @changelog\n    name         : String;\n    cryptoAmount : Decimal;\n    fiatAmount   : Decimal;\n};\n```\n\n`Payment.cds`:\n\n```cds\nentity Payments : cuid {\n    displayId : String; //readable ID\n    @changelog\n    name      : String;\n};\n```\n\nUnion entity in `BusinessTransaction.cds`:\n\n```cds\nentity BusinessTransactions          as(\n    select from payments.Payments{\n        key ID,\n            displayId,\n            name,\n            changes  : Association to many ChangeView\n                on changes.objectID = ID AND changes.entity = 'payments.Payments'\n    }\n)\nunion all\n(\n    select from payables.Payables {\n        key ID,\n            displayId,\n            name,\n            changes  : Association to many ChangeView\n               on changes.objectID = ID AND changes.entity = 'payables.Payables'\n    }\n);\n```\n\n![UnionChange.png](_assets/UnionChange.png)\n\n### Don'ts\n\nDon'ts\n\n#### Use Case 1: Don't trace changes for field(s) with `Association to many`\n\n```cds\nentity Customers : cuid, managed {\n  ...\n  incidents : Association to many Incidents on incidents.customer = $self;\n}\n```\n\nThe reason is that: the relationship: `Association to many` is only for modelling purpose and there is no concrete field in database table. In the above sample, there is no column for incidents in the table Customers, but there is a navigation property of incidents in Customers OData entity metadata.\n\n#### Use Case 2: Don't trace changes for field(s) with *Unmanaged Association*\n\n```cds\nentity AggregatedBusinessTransactionData @(cds.autoexpose) : cuid {\n    FootprintInventory: Association to one FootprintInventories\n                        on  FootprintInventory.month                      = month\n                        and FootprintInventory.year                       = year\n                        and FootprintInventory.FootprintInventoryScope.ID = FootprintInventoryScope.ID;\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThe reason is that: When deploying to relational databases, Associations are mapped to foreign keys. Yet, when mapped to non-relational databases they're just references. More details could be found in [Prefer Managed Associations](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/domain-models#managed-associations). In the above sample, there is no column for FootprintInventory in the table AggregatedBusinessTransactionData, but there is a navigation property FootprintInventoryof in OData entity metadata.\n\n#### Use Case 3: Don't trace changes for CUD on DB entity\n\n```cds\nthis.on(\"UpdateActivationStatus\", async (req) =>\n    // PaymentAgreementsOutgoingDb is the DB entity\n    await UPDATE.entity(PaymentAgreementsOutgoingDb)\n        .where({ ID: paymentAgreement.ID })\n        .set({ ActivationStatus_code: ActivationCodes.ACTIVE });\n);\n```\n\nThe reason is that: Application level services are by design the only place where business logic is enforced. This by extension means, that it also is the only point where e.g. change-tracking would be enabled. The underlying method used to do change tracking is `req.diff` which is responsible to read the necessary before-image from the database, and this method is not available on DB level.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests/suggestions, bug reports etc. via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cap-js/change-tracking/issues).

            "changelog": "# Change Log\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\nThis project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).\n\n## Version 0.22.0 - TBD\n\n## Version 0.21.0 - 2024-05-31\n### Added\n- Added `IEEE754Compatible` flag which, when set to `true`, generates decimal fields as `(number | string)` instead of `number`. This flag will be removed in the long run\n- Added plugin to `cds build` TypeScript projects. Can be explicitly called using `cds build --for typescript`\n\n### Changed\n- Types representing CDS events are now only `declare`d to avoid having to make their properties optional\n- Singular forms in generated _index.js_ files now contain a `.is_singular` property as marker for distinguished handling of singular and plural in the runtime\n- Parameters passed to the CLI now take precedence over configuration contained in the `typer` section of `cds.env`\n\n### Fixed\n- Entities ending with an \"s\" are no longer incorrectly truncated within `extends`-clauses\n- Entity names prefixed with their own namespace (e.g. `Name.Name`, `Name.NameAttachments`) are not stripped of their name prefix\n\n## Version 0.20.2 - 2024-04-29\n### Fixed\n- Referring to a property's type in a function/ action parameter no longer refers to the enclosing entity\n\n## Version 0.20.1 - 2024-04-24\n### Fixed\n- Void actions no longer crash the type generation process\n\n## Version 0.20.0 - 2024-04-23\n### Added\n- Types for actions and functions now expose a `.kind` property which holds the string `'function'` or `'action'` respectively\n- Added the `CdsDate`, `CdsDateTime`, `CdsTime`, `CdsTimestamp` types, which are each represented as a `string`.\n- Plural types can now also contain an optional numeric `$count` property\n\n### Changed\n- Empty `.actions` properties and operations without parameters are now typed as `Record<never, never>` to make it clear they contain nothing and also to satisfy overzealous linters\n\n### Fixed\n- Composition of aspects now properly resolve implicit `typeof` references in their properties\n- Importing an enum into a service will now generate an alias to the original enum, instead of incorrectly duplicating the definition\n- Returning entities from actions/ functions and using them as parameters will now properly use the singular inflection instead of returning an array thereof\n- Aspects are now consistently named and called in their singular form\n- Only detect inflection clash if singular and plural share the same namespace. This also no longer reports `sap.common` as erroneous during type creation \n\n## Version 0.19.0 - 2024-03-28\n### Added\n- Support for `cds.Vector`, which will be represented as `string`\n\n## Version 0.18.2 - 2024-03-21\n### Fixed\n- Resolving `@sap/cds` will now look in the CWD first to ensure a consistent use the same CDS version across different setups\n- Types of function parameters starting with `cds.` are not automatically considered builtin anymore and receive a more thorough check against an allow-list\n\n\n## Version 0.18.1 - 2024-03-13\n### Fix\n- Remove faulty plural for CDS `type` definitions from the generated _index.js_ files\n\n## Version 0.18.0 - 2024-03-12\n### Added\n- Improved support for projections, including projections on inline definitions, and on views, as well as support for explicit exclusion and selection of properties\n\n### Changed\n- [breaking] CDS `type` definitions will not be inflected. Whatever inflection you define them in will be assumed treated as a singular form and will not receive a plural form anymore\n\n## Version 0.17.0 - 2024-03-05\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a bug where refering to an externally defined enum via the `typeof` syntax would crash the type generation\n\n## Version 0.16.0 - 2024-02-01\n### Changed\n- Changed default log level from `NONE` to `ERROR`. See the doc to manually pass in another log level for cds-typer runs\n- Name collisions between automatically generated foreign key fields (`.…_ID`, `.…_code`, etc.) with explicitly named fields will now raise an error\n- Generate CDS types that are actually structured types as if they were entities. This allows the correct representation of mixing aspects and types in CDS inheritance, and also fixes issues with inline enums in such types\n\n### Fixed\n- Externally defined enums can now be used as parameter types in actions\n\n## Version 0.15.0 - 2023-12-21\n### Added\n- Support for [scoped entities](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl#scoped-names)\n- Support for [delimited identifiers](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl#delimited-identifiers)\n\n### Fixed\n- Inline enums are now available during runtime as well\n- Inline enums can now be used as action parameter types as well. These enums will not have a runtime representation, but will only assert type safety!\n- Arrays of inline enum values can now be used as action parameters too. But they will only be represented by their enclosing type for now, i.e. `string`, `number`, etc.\n- Foreign keys of projection entities are now propagated as well\n\n## Version 0.14.0 - 2023-12-13\n### Added\n- Entities that are database views now also receive typings\n\n## Version 0.13.0 - 2023-12-06\n### Changed\n- Enums are now generated ecplicitly in the respective _index.js_ files and don't have to extract their values from the model at runtime anymore\n\n### Added\n- The `excluding` clause in projections now actually excludes the specified properties in the generated types\n\n## Version 0.12.0 - 2023-11-23\n\n### Changed\n- Generate `cds.LargeBinary` as string, buffer, _or readable_ in the case of media content\n\n### Added\n- Added support for the `not null` modifier\n\n### Fixed\n- Now using names of enum values in generated _index.js_ files if no explicit value is present\n\n## Version 0.11.1 - 2023-10-12\n\n### Changed\n\n### Added\n### Fixed\n- Fixed how service names are exported as default export\n\n## Version 0.11.0 - 2023-10-10\n\n### Changed\n\n### Added\n- Autoexposed entities in services are now also generated\n- Each generated class now contains their original fully qualified name in a static `.name` property\n- Inline enums that are defined as literal type of properties are now supported as well (note: this feature is experimental. The location to which enums are generated might change in the future!)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed an error when an entity uses `type of` on a property they have inherited from another entity\n- Fixed an error during draftability propagation when defining compositions on types that are declared inline\n\n### Removed\n- `compileFromCSN` is no longer part of the package's API\n\n## Version 0.10.0 - 2023-09-21\n\n### Changed\n- Actions and functions are now attached to a static `.actions` property of each generated class. This reflects the runtime behaviour better than the former way of generating instance methods\n\n### Added\n\n### Fixed\n\n## Version 0.9.0 - 2023-09-08\n\n### Changed\n\n### Added\n- Support for drafts via `@odata.draft.enabled` annotation\n\n### Fixed\n- Foreign keys are now propagated more than one level (think: `x_ID_ID_ID`)\n\n\n## Version 0.8.0 - 2023-09-05\n\n### Changed\n\n### Added\n\n### Fixed\n- Foreign keys that are inherited via aspects are now also generated in addition to the resolved property (see 0.7.0)\n- Explicitly annotated `@singular` and `@plural` names are now properly used in generated _index.js_ files\n\n\n## Version 0.7.0 - 2023-08-22\n\n### Changed\n\n### Added\n- Support for `[many] $self` syntax in bound action parameters\n- Foreign keys are now present in the generated types in addition to the resolved property\n\n### Fixed\n## Version 0.6.1 - 2023-08-10\n\n### Changed\n\n### Added\n\n### Fixed\n- Removed a warning about circular imports\n\n## Version 0.6.0 - 2023-08-07\n\n### Added\n- Support for `event` syntax\n\n### Fixed\n- Initialise bound actions with stubs to support `\"strict\":true` in _tsconfig.json_\n- Add leading underscore to appease `noUnusedParameters` in strict tsconfigs\n- No longer inflect `type` definitions when they are referenced within entities or other type definitions\n\n## Version 0.5.0 - 2023-07-25\n\n### Changed\n- Facilitate strict property checks. Note: `checkJs: true` must be present in the project's _jsconfig.json_ or _tsconfig.json_ respectively for this feature to become effective\n\n### Added\n- Support for `array of` syntax\n\n### Fixed\n- Generate `string` type for date-related types in CDS definitions\n- Generate `Buffer | string` type for the CDS type `LargeBinary`\n\n\n## Version 0.4.0 - 2023-07-06\n### Added\n- Support for enums when they are defined separately (not inline in the property type of an entity)\n\n## Version 0.3.0 - 2023-06-26\n### Added\n- Support `function` definitions (apart from `action`s)\n### Changed\n- Bump version to next minor\n\n### Fixed\n- Properly import CDS `type` definitions when they are referenced elsewhere\n\n## Version 0.2.5-beta.1 - 2023-06-13\n\n### Changed\n- Bump version\n\n## Version 0.2.4 - 2023-06-12\n- Enable use of annotated singular/ plural names in associations/ compositions\n- Rename package from `@sap/cds-dts-generator` to `@cap-js/cds-typer`\n\n## Version 0.2.3 - 2023-05-17\n- Add missing library files\n\n## Version 0.2.2 - 2023-05-17\n- Make class hierarchy flatter\n\n## Version 0.2.1 - 2023-05-16\n- Add missing files\n\n## Version 0.2.0 - 2023-05-15\n- use native Typescript AST in unit tests\n- add `propertiesOptional` flag\n- support flat, as well as nested inline declarations\n- support `typeof` syntax\n- read rudimentary configuration from cds.env\n- export bound and unbound actions\n- allow inline type definitions within compositions\n- enable use of additional type libraries (HANA types available as first library)\n- provide proper JSDoc for all modules\n- export entity types for singular variants alongside plural types\n## Version 0.1.1 - 2023-01-26\n- add TL;DR section to README\n- allow multiple positional arguments\n\n## Version 0.1.0\n- initial code base\n"

            "readme": "[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/cap-js/notifications)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/cap-js/notifications)\n\n# Notifications Plugin\n\nThe `@cap-js/notifications` package is a [CDS plugin](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-plugins#cds-plugin-packages) that provides support for publishing business notifications in SAP Build WorkZone.\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n- [Setup](#setup)\n- [Send Notifications](#send-notifications)\n- [Use Notification Types](#use-notification-types)\n- [API Reference](#api-reference)\n- [Test-drive Locally](#test-drive-locally)\n- [Run in Production](#run-in-production)\n- [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n- [Licensing](#licensing)\n\n## Setup\n\nTo enable notifications, simply add this self-configuring plugin package to your project:\n\n```sh\n npm add @cap-js/notifications\n```\n\nIn this guide, we use the [Incidents Management reference sample app](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app) as the base, to publish notifications.\n\n## Send Notifications\n\nWith that you can use the NotificationService as any other CAP Service like so in you event handlers:\n\n```js\nconst alert = await cds.connect.to('notifications');\n```\n\nYou can use the following signature to send the simple notification with title and description\n\n```js\nalert.notify({\n  recipients: [ ...supporters() ],\n  priority: \"HIGH\",\n  title: \"New high priority incident is assigned to you!\",\n  description: \"Incident titled 'Engine overheating' created by 'customer X' with priority high is assigned to you!\"\n});\n```\n\n* **priority** - Priority of the notification, this argument is optional, it defaults to NEUTRAL\n* **description** - Subtitle for the notification, this argument is optional\n\n## Use Notification Types\n\n### 1. Add notification types\n\nIf you want to send custom notifications in your application, you can add the notification types in the `srv/notification-types.json` file.\n\nSample: If you want to send the notification when the incident is resolved, you can modify the `srv/notification-types.json` as below:\n\n```json\n  [\n    {\n      \"NotificationTypeKey\": \"IncidentResolved\",\n      \"NotificationTypeVersion\": \"1\",\n      \"Templates\": [\n        {\n          \"Language\": \"en\",\n          \"TemplatePublic\": \"Incident Resolved\",\n          \"TemplateSensitive\": \"Incident '{{title}}' Resolved\",\n          \"TemplateGrouped\": \"Incident Status Update\",\n          \"TemplateLanguage\": \"mustache\",\n          \"Subtitle\": \"Incident from '{{customer}}' resolved by {{user}}.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n```\n\n### 2. Use pre-defined types in your code like that:\n\n```js\n  await alert.notify ('IncidentResolved', {\n    recipients: [ customer.id ],\n    data: {\n      customer: customer.info,\n      title: incident.title,\n      user: cds.context.user.id,\n    }\n  })\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\n* **recipients** - List of the recipients, this argument is mandatory\n* **type** - Notification type key, this argument is mandatory\n* **priority** - Priority of the notification, this argument is optional, it defaults to NEUTRAL\n* **data** - A key-value pair that is used to fill a placeholder of the notification type template, this argument is optional\n\n## Test-drive Locally\nIn local environment, when you publish notification, it is mocked to publish the nofication to the console.\n\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"Notify to console\" style=\"border-radius:0.5rem\" src=\"_assets/notifyToConsole.png\">\n\n## Run in Production\n\n#### Notification Destination\n\nAs a pre-requisite to publish the notification, you need to have a [destination](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-standard-edition/sap-build-work-zone-standard-edition/enabling-notifications-for-custom-apps-on-sap-btp-cloud-foundry#configure-the-destination-to-the-notifications-service) configured to publish the notification. In the `package.json` by default destination name `SAP_Notifications` is added, you can modify the destination name that you are configuring.\n\n#### Integrate with SAP Build Work Zone\n\nOnce application is deployed and integrated with SAP Build Work Zone, you can see the notification under fiori notifications icon!\n\n<img width=\"1300\" alt=\"Sample Application Demo\" style=\"border-radius:0.5rem;\" src=\"_assets/incidentsNotificationDemo.gif\">\n\n\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Custom Notification Types Path\n\nNotifications plugin configures `srv/notification-types.json` as default notification types file. If you are using different file, you can update the file path in `cds.env.requires.notifications.types` \n\n### Custom Notification Type Prefix\n\nTo make notification types unique to the application, prefix is added to the type key. By default, `application name` is added as the prefix. You can update the `cds.env.requires.notifications.prefix` if required.\n\n### Low-level  Notifications API\n\nYou can use these two signature to send the custom notification with pre-defined notification types.\n\n#### With pre-defined parameters\n\nBy using this approach you can send notifications with the predefined parameters - recipients, data, priority, type and other parameters listed in the [API documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-standard-edition/sap-build-work-zone-standard-edition/developing-cloud-foundry-applications-with-notifications) \n\n```js\nalert.notify({\n  recipients: [...supporters()],\n  type: \"IncidentResolved\",\n  priority: 'NEUTRAL',\n  data: {\n    customer: customer.info,\n    title: incident.title,\n    user: cds.context.user.id,\n  },\n  OriginId: \"Example Origin Id\",\n  NotificationTypeVersion: \"1\",\n  ProviderId: \"/SAMPLEPROVIDER\",\n  ActorId: \"BACKENDACTORID\",\n  ActorDisplayText: \"ActorName\",\n  ActorImageURL: \"https://some-url\",\n  NotificationTypeTimestamp: \"2022-03-15T09:58:42.807Z\",\n  TargetParameters: [\n    {\n      \"Key\": \"string\",\n      \"Value\": \"string\"\n    }\n   ]\n  });\n```\n\n#### Passing the whole notification object\n\nBy using this approach you need to pass the whole notification object as described in the [API documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-work-zone-standard-edition/sap-build-work-zone-standard-edition/developing-cloud-foundry-applications-with-notifications)\n\n```js\nalert.notify({\n  NotificationTypeKey: 'IncidentCreated',\n  NotificationTypeVersion: '1',\n  Priority: 'NEUTRAL',\n  Properties: [\n    {\n      Key: 'name',\n      IsSensitive: false,\n      Language: 'en',\n      Value: 'Engine overheating',\n      Type: 'String'\n    },\n    {\n      Key: 'customer',\n      IsSensitive: false,\n      Language: 'en',\n      Value: 'Dave',\n      Type: 'String'\n    }\n  ],\n  Recipients: [{ RecipientId: \"supportuser1@mycompany.com\" },{ RecipientId: \"supportuser2@mycompany.com\" }]\n});\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests/suggestions, bug reports etc. via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cap-js/change-tracking/issues).

Make sure to read the provided documentation at [cap.cloud.sap](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy) to get the full picture. \n\n\n## Preliminaries\n\nIn this guide, we use the [Incidents Management reference sample app](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app) as the base to add change tracking to. Clone the repository and apply the step-by-step instructions:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app\ncd incidents-app\nnpm i\n```\n\n## Setup\nTo enable audit logging, simply add this self-configuring plugin package to your project:\n\n```sh\nnpm add @cap-js/audit-logging\n```\n\n## Annotate Personal Data\nIdentify entities and elements (potentially) holding personal data using `@PersonalData` annotations. Create a `db/data-privacy.cds` file and add the following:\n\n```cds\nusing { sap.capire.incidents as my } from '../db/extensions';\n\nannotate my.Customers with @PersonalData : {\n  DataSubjectRole : 'Customer',\n  EntitySemantics : 'DataSubject'\n} {\n  ID           @PersonalData.FieldSemantics: 'DataSubjectID';\n  firstName    @PersonalData.IsPotentiallyPersonal;\n  lastName     @PersonalData.IsPotentiallyPersonal;\n  email        @PersonalData.IsPotentiallyPersonal;\n  phone        @PersonalData.IsPotentiallyPersonal;\n  creditCardNo @PersonalData.IsPotentiallySensitive;\n};\n\nannotate my.Addresses with @PersonalData: {\n  EntitySemantics : 'DataSubjectDetails'\n} {\n  customer      @PersonalData.FieldSemantics: 'DataSubjectID';\n  city          @PersonalData.IsPotentiallyPersonal;\n  postCode      @PersonalData.IsPotentiallyPersonal;\n  streetAddress @PersonalData.IsPotentiallyPersonal;\n};\n\nannotate my.Incidents with @PersonalData : {\n  EntitySemantics : 'Other'\n} {\n  customer @PersonalData.FieldSemantics: 'DataSubjectID';\n};\n\n```\nLearn more about the annotations in capire:\n- [@PersonalData.EntitySemantics](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy/annotations#entitysemantics)\n- [@PersonalData.EntitySemantics: 'DataSubject'](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy/annotations#datasubjectrole)\n- [@PersonalData.FieldSemantics: 'DataSubjectID'](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy/annotations#fieldsemantics-datasubjectid)\n- [@PersonalData.IsPotentiallyPersonal](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy/annotations#ispotentiallypersonal)\n- [@PersonalData.IsPotentiallySensitive](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy/annotations#ispotentiallysensitive)\n\n\n## Test-Drive Locally\nYou've prepared everything to log personal data-related events. Let's see that in action.\n\nStart the server as usual:\n```sh\ncds watch\n```\n\nSend an update request that changes personal data:\n```http\nPATCH http://localhost:4004/admin/Customers(8e2f2640-6866-4dcf-8f4d-3027aa831cad) HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Basic alice:in-wonderland\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"Johnny\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Doey\"\n}\n```\n\nSee the audit logs in the server's console output:\n```sh\n{\n  data_subject: {\n    type: 'AdminService.Customers',\n    id: { ID: '8e2f2640-6866-4dcf-8f4d-3027aa831cad' },\n    role: 'Customer',\n  },\n  object: {\n   type: 'AdminService.Customers',\n   id: { ID: '8e2f2640-6866-4dcf-8f4d-3027aa831cad' }\n  },\n  attributes: [\n    { name: 'firstName', old: 'John', new: 'Johnny' },\n    { name: 'lastName', old: 'Doe', new: 'Doey' }\n  ],\n  user: 'alice',\n  tenant: 't1',\n  uuid: '1391A703E2CBE52E817269EC7527368C',\n  time: '2023-02-26T08:13:48.287Z'\n}\n```\n\n\n## In Production\n\nThe end-to-end out-of-the-box functionality provided by this plugin requires a paid-for instance of the [SAP Audit Log service for customers](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/audit-log-write-api-for-customers?locale=en-US). However, it is possible to provide an own implementation that writes the audit logs to a custom store.\n\n[_Learn more about using the SAP Audit Log service._](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy/audit-logging#use-sap-audit-log-service)\n\n[_Learn more about custom audit logging._](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/data-privacy/audit-logging#custom-audit-logging)\n\n## Support, Feedback, Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests/suggestions, bug reports etc. via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cap-js/audit-logging/issues).

Having the plugin as dependency signals the intent to audit log.\n- `cds.features.audit_personal_data: true` is no longer necessary. Instead, simply add the plugin as a dependency.\n"

Types describing unlinked CSN should generally not be needed, but are still available through `cds.csn.…`\n\n### Changed\n- Improved signatures for `cds.env.folders` and `cds.env.i18n` from `any` to a more descriptive type\n- `Service.prepend` is no longer async\n- All linked classes are now available via `cds.linked.classes` (and partially via the facade)\n- Getters in `service` instances now return the appropriate classes. E.g. `service.entities` returns instances of `linked.entity`\n- [breaking] Linked definitions are no longer an intersection type of all possible linked classes, but more specific to their actual use (see above). This implies that users may have to narrow the type they are using explicitly, use another getter (see above), or use explicit casts.\n- [breaking] Only the `.after('READ', ...)` differentiates between singular and plural entities. In all other cases the plural case is assumed.\n\n### Fixed\n- `SELECT.from` and related variants now work on the `.drafts` property and behave like `SELECT.from(<Plural>)`\n- `cds.log` can now also be called with the names of log levels\n- Reintroduced missing `QueryAPI.tx` and add deprecation note for `QueryAPI.transaction`\n\n## Version 0.2.0 - 2024-01-17\n\n### Added\n\n- Type for special error listener `srv.on('error')`\n\n### Changed\n\n- `source`, `column_expr`, and `predicate` have been converted to partial intersection types. This offers all possible optional properties. You will have to make sure to check their presence when accessing them\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `srv.send` overload to also allow optional headers\n- Reflected types like `cds.entity`, `cds.struct`, `cds.Association` are now properly exposed\n- `cds.builtin.types` got a more accurate type\n- The `LinkedEntity.drafts` property is now optional.  At runtime, it's only set for drafted entities.\n- `cds.model` is marked as modifiable (for tests only!)\n- `SELECT.from` got its `ref` property back\n\n\n## Version 0.1.0 - 2023-12-13\n\n### Changed\n\n- Rework of the export structure of the main `cds` facade object, so that e.g. `cds.Request` and `cds.User` work again\n\n### Fixed\n\n- TSDoc comments have a proper structure\n\n## Version 0.0.1 - 2023-12-06\n\n### Added\n\n- Initial release, still with gaps though\n"

This release will be more disruptive than usual. We re-thought that main `require` API and\nmade it much leaner. These changes should have happened in 1.0, sorry for the inconvenience.\n\n```javascript\n// before\nconst {\n  singleton: { getFeatureValue },\n} = require(\"@cap-js-community/feature-toggle-library\");\n\nfunction someFunc() {\n  getFeatureValue(key);\n}\n\n// after\nconst toggles = require(\"@cap-js-community/feature-toggle-library\");\n\nfunction someFunc() {\n  toggles.getFeatureValue(key);\n}\n```\n\nFor details see\n[https://cap-js-community.github.io/feature-toggle-library/usage/](https://cap-js-community.github.io/feature-toggle-library/usage/)\n\n### Changed\n\n- the library now exports _only_ the singleton instance (fixes #39).\n- cds-plugin: the request header features are only respected in development environments (fixes #41).\n\n## v1.0.0 - 2023-11-27\n\nWe are releasing 1.0, after 2 years of continuous usage, testing, and small improvements.\n\n### Removed\n\n- restrict to node v18+\n\n### Added\n\n- act as\n  [Feature Vector Provider](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/extensibility/feature-toggles#feature-vector-providers)\n  when used as a CDS-Plugin.\n- allow graceful shutdown by closing redis clients on cds shutdown event (fixes #34).\n\n## v0.7.2 - 2023-10-18\n\n### Added\n\n- support for redis cluster configurations.\n- enable setting maximal log level through env variable `BTP_FEATURES_LOG_LEVEL`. this can be used to silence the\n  library during tests.\n\n### Changed\n\n- implement new CDS-Plugin API, where plugins export a promise instead of an activate property and stay compatible for\n  older cds versions.\n\n## v0.7.1 - 2023-09-13\n\n### Fixed\n\n- CDS-Plugin integration now works for projects that run `cds build --production` and only use the resulting\n  `csn.json` at runtime.\n\n## v0.7.0 - 2023-09-08\n\n### Added\n\n- new harmonized validation configuration for scope and regex checks, as well as external validation with user\n  provided modules.\n\n- new (optional) [CDS-Plugin](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-plugins) integration. for details, see the new\n  [plugin and service](https://cap-js-community.github.io/feature-toggle-library/service/) documentation.\n\n- new logger implementation which replaces\n  [cf-nodejs-logging-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cf-nodejs-logging-support) dependency. it has better cds\n  integration (if present). for example, it will log\n  [correlation ids](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-log#node-observability-correlation) that are present in cds\n  context via [async local storage](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage).\n\n### Changed\n\n- `allowedScopes: [xxx]` configuration will now be ignored and needs to be replaced with\n  `validations: [{ scopes: [xxx] }]`.\n\n- `validation: yyy` configuration will now be ignored and needs to be replaced with\n  `validations: [{ regex: yyy }]`.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- re-work pipelines to separate main branch and pr-voter status\n\n## v0.6.9 - 2023-07-18\n\n### Added\n\n- example http request file for [example-cap-server](./example-cap-server)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- better documentation regarding scoping and redis hash map persistence\n\n- more resilient handling of bad input for scopeMaps in all external APIs\n\n## v0.6.8 - 2023-06-27\n\n### Added\n\n- first public release on npmjs\n\n## v0.6.7 - 2023-06-20\n\n### Added\n\n- added `allowedScopes` configuration, which validates that correct scope names are used for updates\n\n### Fixed\n\n- separate `rootValue` from other `scopedValues` in `getFeatureInfo` and `getFeaturesInfos` APIs\n\n## v0.6.6 - 2023-06-19\n\n### Added\n\n- added `example-cap-server` code, that acts both as an example integration code into existing cap projects and as a\n  starting point for manual testing\n\n### Fixed\n\n- first iteration towards updating documentation\n\n## v0.6.5 - 2023-06-13\n\n### Fixed\n\n- fix bug where scoped values were ignored if they are falsy\n\n## v0.6.4 - 2023-06-11\n\n### Added\n\n- simple migration for old sting-type state to hash-type persistence state\n\n## v0.6.2 - 2023-06-10\n\n### Fixed\n\n- fix redis transaction re-writes\n\n## v0.6.1 - 2023-06-07\n\n### Removed\n\n- remove API to read feature config and metadata `getFeatureConfig` and `getFeatureConfigs`.\n  use `getFeatureInfo` and `getFeaturesInfos` instead\n\n### Added\n\n- new option to add _scope restrictions_ when reading or setting feature toggles\n\n- separate persistence on redis using `HGET`, `HSET`, so that individual toggle changes don't have to touch the state\n  of all feature toggles. effectively we change the redis type for the persistence key from `string` to `hash`.\n\n- new API `getFeatureInfo` and `getFeaturesInfos` to get all config and state information in one call\n\n### Fixed\n\n- rewrite to improve config handling internally\n\n- fix some problems with the logger in combination with verror\n\n## v0.5.18 - 2023-04-25\n\n### Removed\n\n- restrict to node v16+\n\n### Added\n\n- new interface to get `main` and `subscriber` client in redis wrapper\n\n### Fixed\n\n- better coding and interface for `LazyCache` and `ExpiringLazyCache`\n\n- more and improved jsdocs\n\n- allow options to be passed in redis wrapper `set` implementation.\n  see [SET](https://redis.io/commands/set/) for details.\n\n## v0.5.17 - 2022-12-13\n\n### Fixed\n\n- make logging for warn level work properly\n\n## v0.5.16 - 2022-12-08\n\n### Fixed\n\n- re-work logging approach so structured logging will capture [VError](https://www.npmjs.com/package/verror) info\n\n## v0.5.15 -

(reported by @cgaillydetaurines)\n\n## v0.8.3 - 2024-04-26\n\n### Changed\n\n- cds: tenant upgrade now logs progress of individual tasks (`@sap/cds-mtxs` uses one task per tenant) for every poll.\n  the logs will look something like:\n  ```\n  GET https://my-server-mtx.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/-/cds/jobs/pollJob(ID='d2f560dc-542c-4091-a632-919c941210b4') 200 OK (163ms)\n  job d2f560dc-542c-4091-a632-919c941210b4 is RUNNING with tasks queued/running:  5/ 5 | failed/finished:  0/ 0\n  GET https://my-server-mtx.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/-/cds/jobs/pollJob(ID='d2f560dc-542c-4091-a632-919c941210b4') 200 OK (98ms)\n  job d2f560dc-542c-4091-a632-919c941210b4 is RUNNING with tasks queued/running:  4/ 5 | failed/finished:  0/ 1\n  GET https://my-server-mtx.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/-/cds/jobs/pollJob(ID='d2f560dc-542c-4091-a632-919c941210b4') 200 OK (98ms)\n  job d2f560dc-542c-4091-a632-919c941210b4 is RUNNING with tasks queued/running:  1/ 4 | failed/finished:  0/ 5\n  ...\n  ```\n- cds: tenant upgrade now tracks that task progress is still happening. if no progress is detected for 30 minutes, it\n  will show the final status for each tenant and fail.\n\n### Added\n\n- uaa: some arguments can be passed in via environment variable instead of the commandline. this behavior is expected\n  by Jenkins and Github Actions. for example, the following is now possible:\n  ```\n  UAA_USERNAME=user UAA_PASSWORD=pass mtx --uaa-user\n  ```\n\n### Fixed\n\n- sensitive input arguments are now masked in the running console output\n\n## v0.8.2 - 2024-03-15\n\n### Fixed\n\n- removed npm `postinstall` script\n\n### Changed\n\n- hdi: all accesses to service instances and bindings now filter for the service-plan `hdi-shared`. this change allows\n  the service-manager to be used with other services, e.g. `redis-cache`, alongside HANA containers.\n\n## v0.8.1 - 2024-03-05\n\n### Fixed\n\n- uaa: `uaasc`, `uaasp`, `uaasu` error handling and message with passcode url was improved.\n\n### Changed\n\n- reg: improved `regl` and `--registry-update` support for instances with `service` plan. (proposal and provisioning\n  support by @andre68723)\n\n## v0.8.0 - 2024-02-20\n\n### Removed\n\n- hdi: `--hdi-migrate-all` command is removed. Instance manager has been deprecated for a while, so migrations to\n  service-manager have happened by now.\n\n### Changed\n\n- uaa: `uaas  --uaa-service` command has been renamed to `uaasc  --uaa-service-client`. This fits better with the\n  pattern of new commands.\n\n### Added\n\n- uaa: new flexible commands, so that either the regular server or a trusted services can be accessed as a technical\n  client, as a user with passcode, or as a user with username and password. (fixes #62 by @soccermax)\n\n  ```\n  uaac   --uaa-client [TENANT]                                  obtain uaa token for generic client\n  uaap   --uaa-passcode PASSCODE [TENANT]                       obtain uaa token for one-time passcode\n  uaau   --uaa-user USERNAME PASSWORD [TENANT]                  obtain uaa token for username password\n  uaasc  --uaa-service-client SERVICE [TENANT]                  obtain service token for generic client\n  uaasp  --uaa-service-passcode SERVICE PASSCODE [TENANT]       obtain service token for one-time passcode\n  uaasu  --uaa-service-user SERVICE USERNAME PASSWORD [TENANT]  obtain service token for username password\n  ```\n\n### Fixed\n\n- uaa: fix error with recommended passcode url when credential-type x509 is used. (fixes #59)\n\n## v0.7.17 - 2024-01-24\n\n### Changed\n\n- cds: onboard now supports arbitrary subscription metadata\n  https://cap-js-community.github.io/mtx-tool/cap-multitenancy/#onboard-tenant\n\n## v0.7.16 - 2024-01-13\n\n### Added\n\n- srv: new functionality to dump certificates from app server (pr #53) contributed by @kkoile\n\n### Changed\n\n- srv: environment dump now exports VCAP_APPLICATION (pr #55) contributed by @kkoile\n\n## v0.7.15 - 2023-12-21\n\n### Added\n\n- cds: added missing timestamp functionality (fixes #46)\n\n- cds,hdi: allow users to control request concurrency with env variables `MTX_CDS_CONCURRENCY`, `MTX_HDI_CONCURRENCY`\n\n### Changed\n\n- cds,hdi: changed default request concurrency from 5 to 10\n\n## v0.7.14 -

2023-07-12\n\n### Fixed\n\n- cds: auto undeploy for mtxs (#34)\n\n- hdi: allow hdi tenantIds to contain forward slash\n\n- uaa: make uaa service token work with user provided services\n\n## v0.7.10 - 2023-03-13\n\n### Added\n\n- reg: enable update subscribe apps' url (fixes #25) contributed by @jiangxin0503\n\n### Fixed\n\n- homogenize single and multi tenant registry calls\n\n- change function signatures to avoid null parameters\n\n- reg: common enum for registry response states\n\n## v0.7.9 -

            "readme": "# CDS for Cucumber\n\nProvides a library for behaviour-driven tests of CAP applications.\nIt contains ready-to-use steps that help you write tests in a BDD style.\nThe [cucumber](https://cucumber.io) project provides framework for that.\n\nAs of now, the library supports SAP Fiori® Elements as UI framework and OData as communication protocol.\n\nA typical test looks like this:\n\n```gherkin\nFeature: Fiori preview page\n\n  Scenario: Open first Fiori preview page\n    Given we have started the application\n      And we have opened the url \"/\"\n    When we click on first Fiori preview page\n      And we search for \"jane\"\n    Then we expect to have 1 table records\n```\n\nThe project is in early **beta phase**, please expect changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nList of steps and details is available in the [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/cds-cucumber/list_namespace.html).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Setup\n\nInstall the [CAP development toolkit](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/jumpstart#setup):\n\n```sh\nnpm add -g @sap/cds-dk\n```\n\n### Create a project\n\nMake sure you have a CAP project. You can create one with the following command:\n\n```sh\ncds init --add sample bookshop\ncd bookshop\n```\n\n### Configure\n\n```sh\nnpm add -D @cap-js-community/cds-cucumber\nnpx cds-add-cucumber\n```\n\n### Add feature files\n\nFile: test/features/first.feature\n```gherkin\nFeature: Bookshop first feature file\n\n  Scenario: Open \"Manage Books\" as \"alice\" and search for \"jane\"\n    Given we have started the application\n      And we have opened the url \"/\" with user \"alice\"\n    When we select tile \"Manage Books\"\n      And we search for \"jane\"\n    Then we expect to have 2 table records\n```\n\nFor existing projects you have to adjust the example above.\n\n### Run feature tests\n\n```\nnpx cucumber-js test\n```\n\nA recent version of the **chrome browser** should be present on the system.\n\n\n## More\n\nFor additional information see the [details](docs/DETAILS.md) page.\n\n## Support, Feedback, Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests/suggestions, bug reports etc. via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cap-js-community/cds-cucumber/issues).

The following information can be retrieved for analysis:\n\n- **Request:** url, headers, body\n- **Response:** status code/message, headers, body\n\nDebug log level can be activated\n\n- via command line environment variable: `CDS_LOG_LEVELS_COV2AP=debug`\n- via `cds.env` in code: `cds.env.log.levels.cov2ap = \"debug\"`\n\nDetails on how to set CDS environment can be found at [cds.env](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-env).\n\n#### Log Levels\n\nLogging can be configured to respect the following log levels:\n\n- **error**: Error logs are written (includes **warn**)\n- **warn**: Warning logs are written (includes **info**)\n- **info**: Info logs are written (includes **debug**)\n- **debug**: Debug logs are written\n- **trace**: Same as **debug**\n- **silent**: No logs are written\n\n#### Logging Components\n\n##### cds.log.levels.cov2ap: \"error\"\n\n- `[cov2ap] - Proxy:` Proxy processing error\n- `[cov2ap] - Cache:` Metadata cache error\n- `[cov2ap] - Authorization:` Authorization header parsing error\n- `[cov2ap] - MetadataRequest:` Metadata request processing error\n- `[cov2ap] -

Context:` Invalid (sub-)definition (name, path)\n- `[cov2ap] - ContentDisposition:` Content disposition warning\n\n##### cds.log.levels.cov2ap: \"info\"\n\n- `[cov2ap] - Batch:` Changeset order deviation (req, res)\n\n##### cds.log.levels.cov2ap: \"debug\"\n\n- `[cov2ap] - Request:` Log OData V2 client request (url, headers, body)\n- `[cov2ap] - ProxyRequest:` Log OData V4 proxy request (url, headers, body)\n- `[cov2ap] - ProxyResponse:` Log OData V4 proxy response (status code/message, headers, body)\n- `[cov2ap] - Response:` Log OData V2 client response (status code/message, headers, body)\n\n#### http-proxy-middleware\n\n- `[cov2ap] - [HPM]`: Proxy middleware processing logs\n\n### CDS Annotations\n\nThe following OData V2 adapter for CDS specific annotations are supported:\n\n**Service Level**:\n\n- `@protocol: [{ kind: 'odata-v2', path: '<path>' }]`: Specifies an additional custom relative OData V2 protocol service path (prepending OData V2 protocol prefix)\n- `@protocol: [{ kind: 'odata-v2', path: '/<path>' }]`: Specifies an additional custom absolute OData V2 protocol service path (ignoring OData V2 protocol prefix)\n- `@cov2ap.ignore`: Exclude service from OData V2 adapter conversion (service is not exposed as OData V2 service)\n\n**Entity Level**:\n\n- `@cov2ap.analytics: false`: Suppress analytics conversion for the annotated entity, if set to `false`.\n- `@cov2ap.analytics.skipForKey`: Suppress analytical conversion for the annotated entity, if all dimension key elements are requested\n- `@cov2ap.deltaResponse: 'timestamp'`: Delta response '\\_\\_delta' is added to response data of annotated entity with current timestamp information.\n- `@cov2ap.isoTime`: Values of type cds.Time (Edm.Time) are represented in ISO 8601 format for annotated entity.\n- `@cov2ap.isoDate`: Values of type cds.Date (Edm.DateTime) are represented in ISO 8601 format for annotated entity.\n- `@cov2ap.isoDateTime`: Values of type cds.DateTime (Edm.DateTimeOffset) are represented in ISO 8601 format for annotated entity.\n- `@cov2ap.isoTimestamp`: Values of type cds.Timestamp (Edm.DateTimeOffset) are represented in ISO 8601 format for annotated entity.\n- `@cov2ap.isoDateTimeOffset`: Values of type Edm.DateTimeOffset (cds.DateTime, cds.Timestamp) are represented in ISO 8601 format for annotated entity.\n\n**Entity Element Level**:\n\n- `@Core.ContentDisposition.Filename: <element>`: Specifies entity element, representing the filename during file upload/download.\n- `@Core.ContentDisposition.Type: '<value>'`: Controls the content disposition behavior in client/browser (`inline` or `attachment`).\n- `@cov2ap.headerDecode: [...]`: Array of sequential decoding procedures ('uri', 'uriComponent', 'base64') used for media entity upload header.\n\n### CDS Modeling Restrictions\n\nCDS project configuration `cds.odata.version` shall be set to `v4`, as OData V2 maps to OData V4.\nCDS supports modelling features that are not compatible with OData V2 standard:\n\n- **Singletons:** Usage of annotation `@odata.singleton` is not supported in combination with OData V2\n- **Structured Types:** Usage of `cds.odata.structs: true` is not supported in combination with OData V2\n- **Arrayed Types:** Usages of `array of` or `many` in entity element definitions lead to CDS compilation error: `Element must not be an \"array of\" for OData V2`\n- **Managed Compositions:** The usage of managed composition (currently) produces Format Exception in Fiori Elements V2 for Date/Time data types\n\nTo provide an OData V2 service based on the OData V2 adapter for CDS, those CDS modelling features must not be used.\nIn general any CDS OData API flavor must not be used in combination with OData V2 adapter for CDS.\n\nPer default, those modelling incompatibilities are reported as `Warning` and will not stop the compilation.\nThe resulting EDMX V2 may be invalid and not processable by an OData V2 client. To prevent this situation and fail\nearly to detect modelling incompatibilities, the severity for respective codes can be increased to `Error`,\nby setting the following environment variables:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cdsc\": {\n    \"severities\": {\n      \"odata-spec-violation-array\": \"Error\",\n      \"odata-spec-violation-param\": \"Error\",\n      \"odata-spec-violation-returns\": \"Error\",\n      \"odata-spec-violation-assoc\": \"Error\",\n      \"odata-spec-violation-constraints\": \"Error\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Cloud Foundry Deployment\n\nWhen deploying the OData V2 adapter for CDS to Cloud Foundry, make sure that it has access to the whole CDS model.\nEspecially, it’s the case, that normally the Node.js server is only based on folder `srv` and folder `db` is then missing on Cloud Foundry.\n\nTo come around this situation, trigger a `cds build` during development time, that generates a `csn.json` at location `gen/srv/srv/csn.json`.\nPoint your Cloud Foundry deployment of the OData V2 adapter for CDS to the folder `gen/srv` (using manifest.json or MTA), so that\nthe CDS models can be found via file `srv/csn.json`, during runtime execution on Cloud Foundry.\n\nMake sure, that all i18n property files reside next to the `csn.json` in a `i18n` or `_i18n` folder, to be detected by localization.\n\n### Multitenancy, Feature Toggles and Extensibility (MTX)\n\nOData V2 adapter for CDS supports multitenant scenarios. Basic extensibility is already supported in combination with the\n[CDS MTX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-mtx) module. More advanced extensibility scenarios and feature toggles\nare supported in combination with the [CDS Streamlined MTX services](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-mtxs).\n\nIn order to provide the feature toggle vector to be used to build-up the corresponding `CSN` and `EDMX` metadata documents,\nthe Express request object `req` needs to enhanced by feature definitions.\nTo add support for a specific feature toggles management you can add a simple Express middleware as follows, for example, in your `server.js`:\n\n```js\nconst cds = require(\"@sap/cds\");\ncds.on(\"bootstrap\", (app) =>\n  app.use((req, res, next) => {\n    req.features = req.features || [\"advanced\"];\n    next();\n  }),\n);\n```\n\n### Build Task\n\nCDS OData V2 Adapter includes an CDS build task, that allows to prepare the OData V2 EDMX files for MTX sidecar app.\nThe build task is automatically active, in case project is running in multi-tenant context including MTX sidecar.  \nIt can be deactivated using option `cds.cov2ap.build: false`.\n\n### Unit-Tests\n\nThis repository comes with a suite of unit-tests covering the complete proxy implementation.\nThe tests can be executed as follows:\n\n- SQLite based:\n  - `npm run test:unit` ([source](test))\n- HANA based:\n  - Place HANA credentials at `test-integration/_env/db/default-services.json` in format:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"hana\": [\n        {\n          \"credentials\": {}\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n  - Deploy HANA test schema\n    - Switch dir: `cd test-integration/_env`\n    - Build model: `npm run build`\n    - Deploy model: `npm run deploy`\n  - Run tests (root dir): `npm run test:integration` ([source](test-integration))\n- All:\n  - `npm test`\n\nAll tests are executed as part of the GitHub Actions Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.\n\n### SAP Fiori Elements V2\n\nThe OData V2 service provided by the OData V2 adapter for CDS can be used to serve an SAP Fiori Elements V2 UI.\n\nSAP Fiori Elements V2 examples:\n\n- SQLite based:\n  - **Analytics**: Analytical List Page app ([source](test/_env/app/analytics))\n  - **Basic Edit**: Basic editing app ([source](test/_env/app/basic))\n  - **Draft Edit**: Draft supported editing app ([source](test/_env/app/draft))\n  - **Hierarchy**: Hierarchical display of data in tree table ([source](test/_env/app/hierarchy))\n  - **Overview**: Overview Page app ([source](test/_env/app/overview))\n  - **XML**: Basic app (Atom format) ([source](test/_env/app/xml))\n- HANA based:\n  - **Parameters**: Parameterized Entity app ([source](test-integration/_env/app/parameters))\n\nExamples can be tested as follows:\n\n- Start server:\n  - SQLite based: `npm start`\n  - HANA based: `npm run start:hana`\n- Open Fiori Launchpad: http://localhost:4004/flp.html\n\n### Compression Support\n\nResponse compressions can be enabled, by registering the `compression` Node.js\nmodule in Express app at bootstrap time, e.g. in `srv/server.js`:\n\n```js\nconst cds = require(\"@sap/cds\");\nconst cov2ap = require(\"@cap-js-community/odata-v2-adapter\");\nconst compression = require(\"compression\");\n\ncds.on(\"bootstrap\", (app) => {\n  app.use(compression({ filter: shouldCompress }));\n  app.use(cov2ap());\n});\n\nfunction shouldCompress(req, res) {\n  const type = res.getHeader(\"Content-Type\");\n  if (type && typeof type === \"string\" && type.startsWith(\"multipart/mixed\")) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  // fallback to standard filter function\n  return compression.filter(req, res);\n}\n```\n\nThe shown compression filter function enables compression including\nOData Batch (`$batch`) calls with content type `multipart/mixed`.\n\n### Approuter Compression\n\n`@sap/approuter` now support out-of-the-box compression for OData $batch calls with `multipart/mixed`.\nIt's disabled by default, but can be enabled using option [compressResponseMixedTypeContent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/approuter#compression-property).\n\n## Custom Bootstrap\n\n### CAP Node.js Custom\n\n- Run `npm install @cap-js-community/odata-v2-adapter -s` in `@sap/cds` project\n- Create new file `./srv/index.js`:\n\n```js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst cds = require(\"@sap/cds\");\nconst cov2ap = require(\"@cap-js-community/odata-v2-adapter\");\n\nconst host = \"0.0.0.0\";\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 4004;\n\n(async () => {\n  const app = express();\n\n  // OData V2\n  app.use(cov2ap());\n\n  // OData V4\n  await cds.connect.to(\"db\");\n  await cds.serve(\"all\").in(app);\n\n  const server = app.listen(port, host, () => console.info(`app is listing at ${host}:${port}`));\n  server.on(\"error\", (error) => console.error(error.stack));\n})();\n```\n\n- Run `node srv/index` from the project root to start the server:\n  - OData V2 service will be available at http://localhost:4004/odata/v2/<service-path>\n  - OData V4 service will be available at http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/<service-path>\n\nNote that `@sap/cds` is a peer dependency and needs to be available as module as well.\n\n### CAP Java Custom\n\n> For CAP Java projects prefer the Native OData V2 Adapter ([com.sap.cds/cds-adapter-odata-v2](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sap.cds/cds-adapter-odata-v2)).\n\n- Run `npm install @cap-js-community/odata-v2-adapter -s` in `@sap/cds` project\n- Provide CDS models (`db`, `srv`, `app`) or compile a generated CSN (see details below)\n- Create new file `./srv/index.js`:\n\n```js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst cov2ap = require(\"@cap-js-community/odata-v2-adapter\");\n\nconst host = \"0.0.0.0\";\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 4004;\n\n(async () => {\n  const app = express();\n\n  // OData V2\n  app.use(\n    cov2ap({\n      target: \"<odata-v4-backend-url>\", // locally e.g. http://localhost:8080\n      services: {\n        \"<odata-v4-service-path>\": \"<qualified.ServiceName>\",\n      },\n    }),\n  );\n\n  const server = app.listen(port, host, () => console.info(`app is listing at ${host}:${port}`));\n  server.on(\"error\", (error) => console.error(error.stack));\n})();\n```\n\n- Run `node srv/index` from the project root to start the server:\n  - OData V2 service will be available at http://localhost:4004/odata/v2/<odata-v4-service-path>\n  - OData V4 service shall be available e.g. at http://localhost:8080/<odata-v4-service-path>\n\n#### Additional Considerations\n\n- A deployed version of OData V2 adapter for CDS shall have option `target` set to the deployed OData V4 backend URL.\n  This can be retrieved from the Cloud Foundry environment using `process.env`, for example,\n  from the `destinations` environment variable. Locally e.g. http://localhost:8080 can be used.\n- In option `services`, every OData V4 service URL path needs to mapped to\n  the corresponding fully qualified CDS service name, e.g. `\"/odata/v4/MainService/\": \"test.MainService\"`,\n  to establish the back-link connection between OData URL and its CDS service.\n- Make sure, that your CDS models are also available in the project.\n  Those reside either in `db`, `srv`, `add` folders, or a compiled (untransformed) `srv.json` is provided.\n  This can be generated by using the following command: `cds srv -s all -o .`\n- Alternatively, a `cds build` can be triggered as described in section \"Cloud Foundry Deployment\".\n- If not detected automatically, the model path can be set with option `model` (especially if `csn.json`/`srv.json` option is used).\n- Make sure, that all i18n property files reside next to the `csn.json` in a `i18n` or `_i18n` folder, to be detected by localization.\n- In a multitenant scenario in combination with a standalone app, the CDS model can be retrieved remotely via MTX endpoint (`mtxEndpoint`) by setting option `mtxRemote: true`.\n- Option `mtxEndpoint` can be specified as absolute url (starting with `http://` or `https://`), to be able to address MTX Sidecar\n  possibly available under a target different from OData v4 backend URL. If not specified absolutely, `target` is prepended to `mtxEndpoint`.\n\n## Contributions\n\n- Unit Tests: `npm test`\n- Test Server: `npm start`\n  - Service: `http://localhost:4004/odata/v2/main`\n  - Metadata: `http://localhost:4004/odata/v2/main/$metadata`\n  - Data: `http://localhost:4004/odata/v2/main/Header?$expand=Items`\n\nFor more details see [CONTRIBUTION](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.\n\n## Features\n\n- GET, POST, PUT / MERGE / PATCH, DELETE\n- Batch support\n- Actions, Functions\n- Analytical Annotations\n- Deep Expands/Selects\n- JSON, Atom (XML) format\n- Deep Structures\n- Data Type Mapping\n- IEEE754Compatible\n- Messages / Error Handling\n- Location Header\n- $inlinecount / $count / \\$value\n- Entity with Parameters\n- File Upload (binary, multipart/form-data)\n- Stream Support (Octet and Url)\n- Content Disposition\n- Content-ID\n- Multitenancy (mtx, mtxs)\n- Feature Toggles\n- Extensibility\n- Draft Support\n- Search Support\n- Localization\n- Temporal Data\n- Tracing Support\n- Logging Correlation\n- ETag Support (Concurrency Control)\n- Next Links (skiptoken)\n- Delta Responses (deltatoken)\n- Continue-On-Error\n- X-HTTP-Method\n\n## OData V2/V4 Delta\n\n[What’s New in OData Version 4.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/new-in-odata/v4.0/cn01/new-in-odata-v4.0-cn01.html)\n\n## Support, Feedback, Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests/suggestions, bug reports etc. via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cap-js-community/odata-v2-adapter/issues).

With a focus on load balancing, this package ensures optimal\nevent distribution across all available application instances. By providing managed transactions similar to CAP\nhandlers, the Event-Queue framework simplifies event processing, enhancing the overall performance of your application.\n\nAdditionally, Event-Queue provides support for [periodic events](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/configure-event/#periodic-events),\nallowing for processing at defined intervals. This feature further extends its capabilities in load balancing and\ntransaction management, ensuring that even regularly occurring tasks are handled efficiently and effectively without\noverloading any single instance. This makes it an ideal solution for applications needing consistent, reliable event processing.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nDive right in and check out the getting started [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/setup).\n\n## Features\n\nLearn more about features in the [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/#functionality-and-problem-solutions). To compare the\nevent-queue with other SAP products head over to [Distinction from other solutions](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/diff-to-outbox/).\n\n- [load balancing](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/load-balancing) and concurrency control of event processing across app instances\n- [periodic events](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/configure-event/#periodic-events) similar to running cron jobs for business processes\n- [managed transactions](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/transaction-handling) for event processing\n- async processing of processing intensive tasks for better UI responsiveness\n- push/pull mechanism for reducing delay between publish an event and processing\n- cluster published events during processing (e.g. for combining multiple E-Mail events to one E-Mail)\n- [plug and play](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/setup) via cds-plugin\n\n## Documentation\n\nHead over to our [Documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/) to learn more.\n\n## Support, Feedback, Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests/suggestions, bug reports etc.\nvia [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cap-js-communityevent-queue/issues).

The flag `useAsCAPOutbox` replaces the CAP implementation by\n  the event-queue.\n\n## v1.0.3 - 2024-01-08\n\n### Fixed\n\n- update tenant hash for newly onboarded tenants\n- consider running periodic events during update of periodic events\n\n## v1.0.2 - 2024-01-05\n\n### Added\n\n- filter out not invalid tenant ids during processing\n\n## v1.0.1 - 2024-01-04\n\n### Added\n\n- introduced `thresholdLoggingEventProcessing` config variable to adjust logging threshold for event\n  processing [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/setup/#initialization-parameters)\n\n## v1.0.0 - 2023-12-20\n\n### Added\n\n- block the run of periodic events via\n  config [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/configure-event/#blocking-periodic-events)\n- Add a label to the workerQueue. This will help in understanding which events were throttled in case of throttling.\n- The `isEventQueueActive` configuration can now be used to deactivate the runtime processing of all events.\n- with the function `getLastSuccessfulRunTimestamp` the timestamp of the last successful run for a periodic event can be\n  requested. [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/implement-event/#using-the-timestamp-of-the-last-successful-run-for-the-next-run)\n- Added a performance tracer for periodic events. This will log any processing that takes longer than 50ms.\n- Added type and subtype to all performance traces.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Catch exception during Redis channel subscription\n- Endless running if event status open is returned and checkForNextChunk is activated\n\n### Changed\n\n- Refactored the deletion process for completed events. The default setting for deleting processed events has now been\n  updated to a 7-day timeframe.\n  [documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/configure-event/#delete-processed-events)\n- the configuration variable `isRunnerDeactivated` is renamed to `isEventQueueActive`.\n- Reduced the log severity to debug for \"Selected event queue entries for processing\" during periodic events.\n\n## v0.3.0 - 2023-11-30\n\n### Changed\n\n- Removed the `instanceLoadLimit` parameter. The limit is now statically set to 100. The event load should henceforth be\n  specified as a percentage.\n- Upgrade docs dependencies\n- Adjusted workerQueue logging thresholds for waiting time\n\n### Fixed\n\n- fix transaction handling for periodic events\n- set cds.context correctly for periodic runner\n\n## v0.2.5 - 2023-11-16\n\n### Added\n\n- logger get setter for better providing own logger\n\n### Changed\n\n- new documentation\n- improve logging\n\n### Fixed\n\n- small bug fixes and improvements for periodic events\n\n## v0.2.4 - 2023-11-16\n\n### Added\n\n- further improve periodic events\n\n### Changed\n\n- rework of load management and concurrency control\n\n## v0.2.3 - 2023-11-15\n\n### Fixed\n\n- fixes and improvements for periodic events\n\n## v0.2.2 - 2023-11-14\n\n### Added\n\n- periodic events - use event-queue to process periodic jobs\n\n## v0.2.1 - 2023-11-13\n\n### Added\n\n- cds shutdown - close redis clients\n- add redis cluster support\n\n## v0.2.0 - 2023-11-09\n\n### Added\n\n- implementation of delayed events, which allows to publish events that should be processed at a later point in time\n- option to disable redis + refactoring of config\n- improved HANA integration test setup\n\n## v0.1.58 - 2023-11-03\n\n### Changed\n\n- update dependencies\n- remove uuid dependency\n\n## v0.1.56 - 2023-08-31\n\n### Added\n\n- example project\n\n### Fixed\n\n- small bug fixes for local mode\n\n### Changed\n\n- better documentation\n\n## v0.1.55 - 2023-08-17\n\n### Fixed\n\n- fix redis connect client\n\n## v0.1.54 - 2023-08-16\n\n### Added\n\n- allow to distribute config via redis to instances\n\n### Fixed\n\n- move loggers from top-level to functions because cds 7 has different require orders. This the event-queue to use the\n  custom project loggers\n\n## v0.1.53 - 2023-08-07\n\n### Added\n\n- more resilient for small clock shifts in setInterval\n\n## v0.1.52 - 2023-07-31\n\n### Fixed\n\n- fix missing catch for isOutdatedAndKeepalive\n\n## v0.1.51 - 2023-07-27\n\n### Added\n\n- Delete event entries after defined number of days\n- improve exceeded event handling\n\n### Fixed\n\n- fix model loading for cds-plugin\n- fix setInterval clock drift\n\n## v0.1.50 - 2023-07-13\n\n### Added\n\n- new transaction modes\n- register rollback of transaction in combination with returning successful event processing status\n\n## v0.1.49 - 2023-07-05\n\n### Added\n\n- first npm release after internal development\n"

Additional listeners can be registered bypassing CDS definitions and runtime.\nWebSocket server options can be provided via `cds.websocket.options`.\n\nDefault protocol path is `/ws` and can be overwritten via `cds.env.protocols.websocket.path` resp. `cds.env.protocols.ws.path`;\n\n### WebSocket Implementation\n\nThe CDS websocket server supports the following two websocket implementations:\n\n- [WebSocket Standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) (via Node.js [ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) package): `cds.websocket.kind: \"ws\"` **(default)**\n- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io): `cds.websocket.kind: \"socket.io\"`\n- Custom Server: A custom websocket server implementation can be provided via `cds.websocket.impl`\n\nThe server implementation abstracts from the concrete websocket implementation. The websocket client still needs to be implemented websocket implementation specific.\n\n#### WebSocket Service\n\nAnnotated services with websocket protocol are exposed at endpoint: `/ws/<service-path>`:\n\nWebsocket client connection happens as follows for exposed endpoints:\n\n- **WS**: `const socket = new WebSocket(\"ws://localhost:4004/ws/chat\");`\n- **Socket.IO**: `const socket = io(\"/chat\", { path: \"/ws\" })`\n\n#### WebSocket Event\n\nWebsocket services can contain events that are exposed as websocket events. Emitting an event on the service,\nbroadcasts the event to all websocket clients.\n\n```cds\n  @protocol: 'ws'\n  @path: 'chat'\n  service ChatService {\n    event received {\n      text: String;\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nIn addition, also non-websocket services can contain events that are exposed as websocket events:\n\n```cds\n  @protocol: 'odata'\n  @path: 'chat'\n  service ChatService {\n    entity Chat as projection on chat.Chat;\n    function message(text: String) returns String;\n    @websocket\n    event received {\n      text: String;\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nAlthough the service is exposed as an OData protocol at `/odata/v4/chat`, the service events annotated with `@websocket` or\n`@ws` are exposed as websocket events under the websocket protocol path as follows: `/ws/chat`. Entities and operations\nare not exposed, as the service itself is not marked as websocket protocol.\n\n> Non-websocket service events are only active when at least one websocket enabled service is available (i.e. websocket protocol adapter is active).\n\n### Server Socket\n\nEach CDS handler request context is extended to hold the current server `socket` instance of the event.\nIt can be accessed via the service websocket facade via `req.context.ws.service` or `cds.context.ws.service`.\nIn addition the native websocket server socket can be accessed via `req.context.ws.socket` or `cds.context.ws.socket`.\nEvents can be directly emitted via the native `socket`, bypassing CDS runtime, if necessary.\n\n#### Service Facade\n\nThe service facade provides native access to websocket implementation independent of CDS context. It abstracts from the\nconcrete websocket implementation by exposing the following public interface:\n\n- `service: String`: Service name/path\n- `socket: Object`: Server socket\n- `context: Object`: Current CDS context object for the websocket server socket\n- `on(event: String, callback: Function)`: Register websocket event\n- `async emit(event, data)`: Emit websocket event with data\n- `async broadcast(event: String, data: Object, user: String?, contexts: String[]?)`: Broadcast websocket event (except to sender) by excluding an user (optional) or restricting to contexts (optional)\n- `async broadcastAll(event: String, data: Object, user: String?, contexts: String[]?)`: Broadcast websocket event (including to sender) by excluding an user (optional) or restricting to contexts (optional)\n- `async enter(context: String)`: Enter a context\n- `async exit(context: String)`: Exit a context\n- `async disconnect()`: Disconnect server socket\n- `onDisconnect(callback: Function)`: Register callback function called on disconnect of server socket\n\n### Middlewares\n\nFor each server websocket connection the standard CDS middlewares are applied. That means, that especially the correct CDS\ncontext is set up and the configured authorization strategy is applied.\n\n### Tenant Isolation\n\nWebSockets are processed tenant aware. Especially for broadcasting events tenant isolation is ensured, that only\nwebsocket clients connected for the same tenant are notified in tenant context. Tenant isolation is also ensured\nover remote distribution via Redis.\n\n### Authentication & Authorization\n\nAuthentication only works via AppRouter (e.g. using a UAA configuration), as the auth token is forwarded\nvia authorization header bearer token by AppRouter to backend instance. CDS middlewares process the auth token and\nset the auth info accordingly. Authorization scopes are checked as defined in the CDS services `@requires` annotations and\nauthorization restrictions are checked as defined in the CDS services `@restrict` annotations.\n\n### Transactional Safety\n\nIn most situations only websocket events shall be broadcast, in case the primary transaction succeeded.\nIt can be done manually, by emitting CDS event as part of the `req.on(\"succeeded\")` handler.\n\n```js\nreq.on(\"succeeded\", async () => {\n  await srv.emit(\"received\", req.data);\n});\n```\n\nAlternatively you can leverage the CAP in-memory outbox via `cds.outboxed` as follows:\n\n```js\nconst chatService = cds.outboxed(await cds.connect.to(\"ChatService\"));\nawait chatService.emit(\"received\", req.data);\n```\n\nThis has the benefit, that the event emitting is coupled to the success of the primary transaction.\nStill the asynchronous event processing could fail, and would not be retried anymore.\nThat's where the CDS persistent outbox comes into play.\n\n#### CDS Persistent Outbox\n\nWebsocket events can also be sent via the CDS persistent outbox. That means, the CDS events triggering the websocket broadcast\nare added to the CDS persistent outbox when the primary transaction succeeded. The events are processed asynchronously\nand transactional safe in a separate transaction. It is ensured, that the event is processed in any case, as outbox keeps the\noutbox entry open, until the event processing succeeded.\n\nThe transactional safety can be achieved using `cds.outboxed` with kind `persistent-outbox` as follows:\n\n```js\nconst chatService = cds.outboxed(await cds.connect.to(\"ChatService\"), {\n  kind: \"persistent-outbox\",\n});\nawait chatService.emit(\"received\", req.data);\n```\n\nIn that case, the websocket event is broadcast to websocket clients exactly once, when the primary transaction succeeds.\nIn case of execution errors, the event broadcast is retried automatically, while processing the persistent outbox.\n\n### Event User\n\nEvents are broadcast to all websocket clients, including clients established in context of current event context user.\nTo influence event broadcasting based on current context user, the annotation `@websocket.user` or `@ws.user` is available on\nevent type level and event type element level (alternatives include `@websocket.broadcast.user` or `@ws.broadcast.user`):\n\nValid annotation values are:\n\n- **Event type level**:\n  - `'excludeCurrent'`: Current event context user is statically excluded everytime during broadcasting to websocket clients.\n    All websocket clients established in context to that user are not respected during event broadcast.\n- **Event type element level**:\n  - `'excludeCurrent'`: Current event context user is dynamically excluded during broadcasting to websocket clients,\n    based on the value of the annotated event type element.\n    If truthy, all websocket clients established in context to that user are not respected during event broadcast.\n\n### Event Contexts\n\nIt is possible to broadcast events to a subset of clients. By entering or exiting contexts, the server can be instructed to\ndetermined based on the event type, to which subset of clients the event shall be emitted. To specify which data parts of the\nevent are leveraged for setting up the context, the annotation `@websocket.context` or `@ws.context` is available on\nevent type element level (alternatives include `@websocket.broadcast.context` or `@ws.broadcast.context`). For static contexts\nthe annotation can also be used on event type level, providing a static event context string.\n\n```cds\nevent received {\n  @websocket.context\n  ID: UUID;\n  text: String;\n}\n```\n\nThis sets up the event context based on the unique ID of the event type data.\n\nThe annotation can be used on multiple event type elements setting up different event contexts in parallel,\nif event shall be broadcast/emitted into multiple contexts at the same time.\n\n```cds\nevent received {\n  @websocket.context\n  ID: UUID;\n  @websocket.context\n  name: String;\n  text: String;\n}\n```\n\nEvent contexts can also be established via event type elements of `many` or `array of` type:\n\n```cds\nevent received {\n  @websocket.context\n  ID: many UUID;\n  text: String;\n}\n```\n\nThis allows setting up an unspecified number of different event contexts in parallel during runtime.\n\nEvent contexts support all CDS/JS types. The serialization is performed as follows:\n\n- `Date`: `context.toISOString()`\n- `Object`: `JSON.stringify(context)`\n- other: `String(context)`\n\nTo manage event contexts the following options exist:\n\n- **Server side**: Call websocket service facade\n  - CDS context object `req` exposes the websocket facade via `req.context.ws.service` providing the following context functions\n    - **Enter Context**: `enter(context)` - Enter the current server socket into the passed context\n    - **Exit Context**: `exit(context)` - Exit the current server socket from the passed context\n- **Client side**: Emit `wsContext` event from client socket\n  - **Enter Context**:\n    - WS Standard:\n      ```js\n      socket.send(JSON.stringify({ event: \"wsContext\", data: { context: \"...\" } }));\n      ```\n    - Socket.IO:\n      ```js\n      socket.emit(\"wsContext\", { context: \"...\" });\n      ```\n  - **Exit**:\n    - WS Standard:\n      ```js\n      socket.send(JSON.stringify({ event: \"wsContext\", data: { context: \"...\", exit: true } }));\n      ```\n    - Socket.IO:\n      ```js\n      socket.emit(\"wsContext\", { context: \"...\", exit: true });\n      ```\n\nMultiple contexts can be entered for the same server socket at the same time. Furthermore, a service operation named\n`wsContext` is invoked, if existing on the websocket enabled CDS service. Event context isolation is also ensured\nover remote distribution via Redis.\n\nFor Socket.IO (`kind: socket.io`) contexts are implemented leveraging [Socket.IO rooms](https://socket.io/docs/v4/rooms/).\n\n### Event Client Identifier\n\nEvents are broadcast to all websocket clients, including clients that performed certain action. In some cases, the  \nwebsocket client shall not be informed about the event, that was triggered by the same client (maybe via a different channel, e.g. OData).\nTherefore, websocket clients can be identified optionally by a unique identifier provided as URL parameter option `?id=<globally unique value>`.\nThe annotation `@websocket.identifier` or `@ws.identifier` is available on event type level and event type element level\nto influence event broadcasting based websocket client identifier (alternatives include `@websocket.broadcast.identifier` or `@ws.broadcast.identifier`):\n\nValid annotation values are:\n\n- **Event type level**:\n  - Provide a static unique identifier to exclude the client from event broadcasting\n- **Event type element level**:\n  - Value from event data for the annotated element is used as unique identifier to exclude the websocket client from event broadcasting\n  - First annotated element with an defined event data value is taken\n\nThe unique identifier can be provided for a websocket client as follows:\n\n- WS Standard:\n  ```js\n  socket = new WebSocket(\"ws://localhost:4004/ws/chat?id=1234\");\n  ```\n- Socket.IO:\n  ```js\n  const socket = io(\"/chat?id=1234\", { path: \"/ws\" });\n  ```\n\n### Event Emit Headers\n\nThe websocket implementation allows to provide event emit headers to dynamically control websocket processing.\nThe following headers are available:\n\n- `excludeCurrentUser: boolean, wsExcludeCurrentUser: boolean`: Exclude current user from event broadcasting (see section Event User)\n- `contexts: String[], wsContexts: String[]`: Provide an array of context strings to identify a subset of clients (see section Event Contexts)\n- `identifier: String, wsIdentifier: String`: Exclude an websocket client via its identifier (see section Event Client Identifier)\n\nEmitting events with headers can be performed as follows:\n\n```js\nawait srv.emit(\"customEvent\", { ... }, {\n  contexts: [\"...\"],\n  excludeCurrentUser: req.data.type === \"1\",\n  identifier: \"...\",\n});\n```\n\nThe respective event annotations (described in sections above) are respected in addition to event emit header specification,\nso that primitive typed values have priority when specified as part of headers and array-like data is unified.\n\n### Connect & Disconnect\n\nEvery time a server socket is connected via websocket client, the CDS service is notified by calling the corresponding service operation:\n\n- `Connect`: Invoke service operation `wsConnect`, if available\n- `Disconnect`: Invoke service operation `wsDisconnect`, if available\n\n#### Approuter\n\nAuthorization in provided in production by approuter component (e.g. via XSUAA auth).\nValid UAA bindings for approuter and backend are necessary, so that the authorization flow is working.\nLocally, the following default environment files need to exist:\n\n- `test/_env/default-env.json`\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"VCAP_SERVICES\": {\n      \"xsuaa\": [{}]\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- `test/_env/approuter/default-services.json`\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"uaa\": {}\n  }\n  ```\n\nApprouter is configured to support websockets in `xs-app.json` according to [@sap/approuter - websockets property](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/approuter#websockets-property):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"websockets\": {\n    \"enabled\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Local\n\nFor local testing a mocked basic authorization is hardcoded in `flp.html/index.html`.\n\n### Operations\n\nOperations comprise actions and function in the CDS service that are\nexposed by CDS service either unbound (static level) or bound (entity instance level).\nOperations are exposed as part of the websocket protocol as described below.\nOperation results will be provided via optional websocket acknowledgement callback.\n\n> Operation results are only supported with Socket.IO (`kind: socket.io`) using acknowledgement callbacks.\n\n#### Unbound\n\nEach unbound function and action is exposed as websocket event.\nThe signature (parameters and return type) is passed through without additional modification.\nOperation result will be provided as part of acknowledgment callback.\n\n##### Special operations\n\nThe websocket adapter tries to call the following special operations on the CDS service, if available:\n\n- `wsConnect`: Callback to notify that a socket was connected\n- `wsDisconnect`: Callback to notify that a socket was disconnected\n- `wsContext`: Callback to notify that a socket changed the event context (details see section Event Contexts)\n\n#### Bound\n\nEach service entity is exposed as CRUD interface via as special events as proposed [here](https://socket.io/get-started/basic-crud-application/).\nThe event is prefixed with the entity name and has the CRUD operation as suffix, e.g. `Books:create`.\nIn addition, also bound functions and actions are included into these schema, e.g. `Books:sell`.\nThe signature (parameters and return type) is passed through without additional modification.\nIt is expected, that the event payload contains the primary key information.\nCRUD/action/function result will be provided as part of acknowledgment callback.\n\n#### CRUD\n\nCreate, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) actions are mapped to websocket events as follows:\n\n- `<entity>:create`: Create an entity instance\n- `<entity>:read`: Read an entity instance by key\n- `<entity>:readDeep`: Read an entity instance deep (incl. deep compositions) by key\n- `<entity>:update`: Update an entity instance by key\n- `<entity>:delete`: Delete an entity instance by key\n- `<entity>:list`: List all entity instances\n- `<entity>:<operation>`: Call a bound entity operation (action/function)\n\nEvents can be emitted and the response can be retrieved via acknowledgment callback.\n\n#### CRUD Broadcast Events\n\nCRUD events that modify entities automatically emit another event after successful processing:\n\n- `<entity>:create => <entity>:created`: Entity instance has been updated\n- `<entity>:update => <entity>:updated`: Entity instance has been created\n- `<entity>:delete => <entity>:deleted`: Entity instance has been deleted\n\nBecause of security concerns, it can be controlled which data of those events is broadcast,\nvia annotations `@websocket.broadcast` or `@ws.broadcast` on entity level.\n\n- Propagate only key via one of the following options (default, if no annotation is present):\n  - `@websocket.broadcast = 'key'`\n  - `@websocket.broadcast.content = 'key'`\n  - `@ws.broadcast = 'key'`\n  - `@ws.broadcast.content = 'key'`\n- Propagate complete entity data via one of the following options:\n  - `@websocket.broadcast = 'data'`\n  - `@websocket.broadcast.content = 'data'`\n  - `@ws.broadcast = 'data'`\n  - `@ws.broadcast.content = 'data'`\n- Propagate no data (hence suppress CRUD broadcast event) via one of the following options:\n  - `@websocket.broadcast = 'none'`\n  - `@websocket.broadcast.content = 'none'`\n  - `@ws.broadcast = 'none'`\n  - `@ws.broadcast.content = 'none'`\n\nIf the CRUD broadcast event is modeled as part of CDS service the annotations above are ignored for that event,\nand the broadcast data is filtered along the event type elements. As character `:` is not allowed in CDS service event names,\ncharacter `:` is replaced by a scoped event name using character `.`.\n\n**Example:**\nWebSocket Event: `Object:created` is mapped to CDS Service Event: `Object.created`\n\nPer default, events are broadcast to every connected socket, expect the socket, that was called with the CRUD event.\nTo also include the triggering socket within the broadcast, this can be controlled via annotations\n`@websocket.broadcast.all` or `@ws.broadcast.all` on entity level.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Todo (UI5)\n\nThe example UI5 `todo` application using Socket.IO can be found at `test/_env/app/todo`.\n\nExample application can be started by:\n\n- Basic Auth\n  - Starting backend: `npm start`\n  - Open in browser: http://localhost:4004/flp.html#Todo-manage\n- XSUAA Auth:\n  - Starting approuter: `npm run start:approuter`\n  - Starting backend: `npm run start:uaa`\n  - Open in browser: http://localhost:5001/flp.html#Todo-manage\n\n#### Chat (HTML)\n\nAn example `chat` application using Socket.IO can be found at `test/_env/app/chat`.\n\nExample application can be started by:\n\n- Basic Auth:\n  - WebSocket Standard: `npm start`\n    - Browser: http://localhost:4004/chat_ws/index.html\n  - Socket.IO: `npm run start:socketio`\n    - Browser: http://localhost:4004/chat_socketio/index.html\n- XSUAA Auth:\n  - Approuter: `npm run start:approuter`\n  - WebSocket Standard: `npm run start:uaa`\n    - Browser: http://localhost:5001/chat_ws/index.html\n  - Socket.IO: `npm run start:socketio:uaa`\n    - Browser: http://localhost:5001/chat_socketio/index.html\n\n### Unit-Tests\n\nUnit-test can be found in folder `test` and can be executed via `npm test`;\nThe basic unit-test setup for WebSockets in CDS context looks as follows:\n\n#### WS\n\n```js\n\"use strict\";\n\nconst cds = require(\"@sap/cds\");\nconst WebSocket = require(\"ws\");\n\ncds.test(__dirname + \"/..\");\n\nconst authorization = `Basic ${Buffer.from(\"alice:alice\").toString(\"base64\")}`;\n\ndescribe(\"WebSocket\", () => {\n  let socket;\n\n  beforeAll((done) => {\n    const port = cds.app.server.address().port;\n    socket = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:${port}/ws/chat`, {\n      headers: {\n        authorization,\n      },\n    });\n  });\n\n  afterAll(() => {\n    cds.ws.close();\n    socket.close();\n  });\n\n  test(\"Test\", (done) => {\n    socket.send(\n      JSON.stringify({\n        event: \"event\",\n        data: {},\n      }),\n    );\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Socket.io\n\n```js\n\"use strict\";\n\nconst cds = require(\"@sap/cds\");\nconst ioc = require(\"socket.io-client\");\n\ncds.test(__dirname + \"/..\");\n\ncds.env.websocket = {\n  kind: \"socket.io\",\n};\n\nconst authorization = `Basic ${Buffer.from(\"alice:alice\").toString(\"base64\")}`;\n\ndescribe(\"WebSocket\", () => {\n  let socket;\n\n  beforeAll((done) => {\n    const port = cds.app.server.address().port;\n    socket = ioc(`http://localhost:${port}/chat`, {\n      path: \"/ws\",\n      extraHeaders: {\n        authorization,\n      },\n    });\n    socket.on(\"connect\", done);\n  });\n\n  afterAll(() => {\n    cds.ws.close();\n    socket.disconnect();\n  });\n\n  test(\"Test\", (done) => {\n    socket.emit(\"event\", {}, (result) => {\n      expect(result).toBeDefined();\n      done();\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### Adapters (Socket.IO)\n\nAn Adapter is a server-side component which is responsible for broadcasting events to all or a subset of clients.\n\n#### Redis\n\nEvery event that is sent to multiple clients is sent to all matching clients connected to the current server\nand published in a Redis channel, and received by the other websocket servers of the cluster.\nThe app needs to be bound to a Redis service instance to set up and connect Redis client.\n\n##### WS Standard\n\nThe following adapters for WS Standard are supported out-of-the-box.\n\n###### Redis\n\nTo use the Redis Adapter (basic publish/subscribe), the following steps have to be performed:\n\n- Set `cds.websocket.adapter.impl: \"redis\"`\n- Application needs to be bound to a Redis instance\n  - Cloud Foundry: Redis is automatically active\n    - Use option `cds.websocket.adapter.active: false` to disable Redis adapter\n  - Other Environment (e.g. Kyma): Redis is NOT automatically active\n    - Use option `cds.websocket.adapter.active: true` to enable Redis adapter\n  - Local: Redis is NOT automatically active\n    - Use option `cds.websocket.adapter.local: true` to enable Redis adapter\n    - File `default-env.json` need to exist with Redis configuration\n- Redis Adapter options can be specified via `cds.websocket.adapter.options`\n- Redis channel key can be specified via `cds.websocket.adapter.options.key`. Default value is `websocket`.\n- Redis client connection configuration can be passed via `cds.websocket.adapter.config`\n\n###### Custom Adapter\n\nA custom websocket adapter implementation can be provided via relative path set configuration of `cds.websocket.adapter.impl`.\n\n##### Socket.IO\n\nThe following adapters for Socket.IO are supported out-of-the-box.\n\n###### Redis Adapter\n\nTo use the Redis Adapter, the following steps have to be performed:\n\n- Install Redis Adapter dependency:\n  `npm install @socket.io/index-adapter`\n- Set `cds.websocket.adapter.impl: \"@socket.io/index-adapter\"`\n- Application needs to be bound to a Redis instance\n  - Locally a `default-env.json` file need to exist with index configuration\n- Redis Adapter options can be specified via `cds.websocket.adapter.options`\n- Redis channel key can be specified via `cds.websocket.adapter.options.key`. Default value is `socket.io`.\n\nDetails:\nhttps://socket.io/docs/v4/index-adapter/\n\n###### Redis Streams Adapter\n\nTo use the Redis Stream Adapter, the following steps have to be performed:\n\n- Install Redis Streams Adapter dependency:\n  `npm install @socket.io/index-streams-adapter`\n- Set `cds.websocket.adapter.impl: \"@socket.io/index-streams-adapter\"`\n- Application needs to be bound to a Redis instance\n  - Locally a `default-env.json` file need to exist with index configuration\n- Redis Streams Adapter options can be specified via `cds.websocket.adapter.options`\n- Redis channel key can be specified via `cds.websocket.adapter.options.streamName`. Default value is `socket.io`.\n\nDetails:\nhttps://socket.io/docs/v4/index-streams-adapter/\n\n### Deployment\n\nThis module also works on a deployed infrastructure like Cloud Foundry (CF) or Kubernetes (K8s).\n\nAn example Cloud Foundry deployment can be found in `test/_env`:\n\n- `cd test/_env`\n  - Use [manifest.yml](test/_env/manifest.yml)\n- `npm run cf:push`\n  - Prepares modules `approuter` and `backend` in `test/_env` and pushes to Cloud Foundry\n    - Approuter performs authentication flow with XSUAA and forwards to backend\n    - Backend serves endpoints (websocket, odata) and UI apps (runs on an in-memory SQLite3 database)\n\nIn deployed infrastructure, websocket protocol is exposed via Web Socket Secure (WSS) at `wss://` over an encrypted TLS connection.\nFor WebSocket standard the following setup in browser environment is recommended to cover deployed and local use-case:\n\n```js\nconst protocol = window.location.protocol === \"https:\" ? \"wss://\" : \"ws://\";\nconst socket = new WebSocket(protocol + window.location.host + \"/ws/chat\");\n```\n\n## Support, Feedback, Contributing\n\nThis project is open to feature requests/suggestions, bug reports etc. via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cap-js-community/websocket/issues).

[Installation](#1-installation) 💻\r\n2. [Usage](#2-usage) ⌨️\r\n3. [Decorator Reference](#3-decorator-reference) 📋\r\n4. [Example](#4-example) 🧷\r\n5. [Bugs and Features](#5-bugs-and-features) 🐞💡\r\n6. [License](#6-license) 📃\r\n\r\n## 1. Installation\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install cds-routing-handlers\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n$ yarn add cds-routing-handlers\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore you can use it you also need to install `reflect-metadata`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install reflect-metadata\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n$ yarn add reflect-metadata\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce installed, make sure you import it before using CDS Routing-Handlers.\r\nMy recommendation would be to place the import at the top of your main entry file.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport \"reflect-metadata\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, one last step is required to use it. We need to tell the Typescript compiler to use decorators.\r\n\r\nPlace the following settings in your `tsconfig.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\r\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Usage\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst express = require(\"express\");\r\n\r\nfunction registerHandlers(srv) {\r\n    srv.on(\"READ\", \"Entity\", async () => {\r\n        // Handle the read here...\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst server = express();\r\ncds.serve(\"./gen/\")\r\n    .at(\"odata\")\r\n    .in(server)\r\n    .with(registerHandlers);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**With CDS Routing-Handlers:**\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// ./handlers/entity.handler.ts\r\n\r\nimport { Handler, OnRead } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\n\r\n@Handler(\"Entity\")\r\nexport class EntityHandler {\r\n    @OnRead()\r\n    public async read(@Srv() srv: any, @Req() req: any): Promise<void> {\r\n        // Handle the read here...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// ./server.ts\r\n\r\nimport express from \"express\";\r\nimport { createCombinedHandler } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\n\r\nconst server = express();\r\n\r\n// Either:\r\nconst handler = createCombinedHandler({\r\n    handler: [__dirname + \"/handlers/**/*.js\"],\r\n});\r\n\r\ncds.serve(\"./gen/\")\r\n    .at(\"odata\")\r\n    .in(server)\r\n    .with(handler);\r\n\r\n// OR\r\n\r\nimport { EntityHandler } from \"./handlers/entity.handler.ts\";\r\n\r\nconst handler = createCombinedHandler({\r\n    handler: [EntityHandler],\r\n});\r\n\r\ncds.serve(\"./gen/\")\r\n    .at(\"odata\")\r\n    .in(server)\r\n    .with(handler);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Depencency Injection Support\r\n\r\nCDS Routing-Handlers can be used in conjunction with [typedi](https://github.com/typestack/typedi).\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { useContainer } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\nimport { Container } from \"typedi\";\r\n\r\nuseContainer(Container);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it now you can inject service into your handler classes.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Handler, Func, Param } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\nimport { Service, Inject } from \"typedi\";\r\n\r\n@Service()\r\nexport class GreeterService {\r\n    public greet(name: string): string {\r\n        return \"Hello, \" + name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Handler()\r\nexport class GreeterHandler {\r\n    @Inject()\r\n    private greeterService: GreeterService;\r\n\r\n    @Func(\"hello\")\r\n    public async hello(@Param(\"name\") name: string): Promise<string> {\r\n        return this.greeterService.greet(name);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Middleware\r\n\r\nIn addition to the before handler you can implement custom middlewares for either the complete service (global) or a specific entity.\r\n\r\n#### Global Middleware\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// ./global.middleware.ts\r\n\r\nimport { ICdsMiddleware, Middleware, Req, Jwt } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\n\r\n@Middleware({ global: true, priority: 1 })\r\nexport class GobalMiddleware implements ICdsMiddleware {\r\n    // You can inject the request parameters as you would in any other handler.\r\n    public async use(@Req() req: any, @Jwt() jwt: string): Promise<void> {\r\n        console.log(\"I am global middleware prio 1\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// ./server.ts\r\n\r\nimport express from \"express\";\r\nimport { createCombinedHandler } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\nimport { GlobalMiddleware } from \"./global.middleware\";\r\n\r\nconst server = express();\r\n\r\nconst handler = createCombinedHandler({\r\n    handler: [__dirname + \"/handlers/**/*.js\"],\r\n    middlewares: [GlobalMiddleware],\r\n});\r\n\r\ncds.serve(\"./gen/\")\r\n    .at(\"odata\")\r\n    .in(server)\r\n    .with(handler);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Handler Middleware\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// ./handler.middleware.ts\r\n\r\nimport { ICdsMiddleware, Middleware, Req, Jwt } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\n\r\n@Middleware() // Omit options for handler middlewares\r\nexport class HandlerMiddleware implements ICdsMiddleware {\r\n    // You can inject the request parameters as you would in any other handler.\r\n    public async use(@Req() req: any, @Jwt() jwt: string): Promise<void> {\r\n        console.log(\"I am handler middleware!\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// ./handlers/entity.handler.ts\r\n\r\nimport { Handler, Use, OnRead } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\nimport { HandlerMiddleware } from \"../handler.middleware\";\r\n\r\n@Handler(\"Entity\")\r\n@Use(HandlerMiddleware)\r\nexport class EntityHandler {\r\n    @OnRead()\r\n    public async read(@Srv() srv: any, @Req() req: any): Promise<void> {\r\n        // Handle the read here...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// ./server.ts\r\n\r\nimport express from \"express\";\r\nimport { createCombinedHandler } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\nimport { HandlerMiddleware } from \"./handler.middleware\";\r\n\r\nconst server = express();\r\n\r\nconst handler = createCombinedHandler({\r\n    handler: [__dirname + \"/handlers/**/*.js\"],\r\n    middlewares: [HandlerMiddleware],\r\n});\r\n\r\ncds.serve(\"./gen/\")\r\n    .at(\"odata\")\r\n    .in(server)\r\n    .with(handler);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### User Checker\r\n\r\nTo avoid duplicate code for user retrieval in all handlers over the JWT token you can implement a user checker which lets you inject your custom user object with the `@User()` decorator.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// ./custom.userchecker.ts\r\n\r\nimport { IUserChecker, UserChecker, Jwt } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\n\r\nexport interface IUser {\r\n    username: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@UserChecker() // Omit options for handler middlewares\r\nexport class CustomUserChecker implements IUserChecker {\r\n    // You can inject the request parameters as you would in any other handler.\r\n    // NOTE: With one exception the @User() decorator will not work.\r\n    public async check(@Jwt() jwt: string): Promise<IUser> {\r\n        // Custom code here to create user from JWT...\r\n        // Let's fake it here\r\n        return {\r\n            username: \"mrbandler\",\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// ./handlers/entity.handler.ts\r\n\r\nimport { Handler, OnRead } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\nimport { IUser } from \"../custom.userchecker\";\r\n\r\n@Handler(\"Entity\")\r\nexport class EntityHandler {\r\n    @OnRead()\r\n    public async read(@User() user: IUser): Promise<void> {\r\n        // Use your custom user object in the read logic...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// ./server.ts\r\n\r\nimport express from \"express\";\r\nimport { createCombinedHandler } from \"cds-routing-handlers\";\r\nimport { CustomUserChecker } from \"./custom.userchecker\";\r\n\r\nconst server = express();\r\n\r\nconst handler = createCombinedHandler({\r\n    handler: [__dirname + \"/handlers/**/*.js\"],\r\n    userChecker: CustomUserChecker,\r\n});\r\n\r\ncds.serve(\"./gen/\")\r\n    .at(\"odata\")\r\n    .in(server)\r\n    .with(handler);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Complete Handler API\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Handler }

            "readme": "# Extend SAP Cloud Application Programming Model(CAP) Validations with the CAPVAL Plugin\nSAP CAPVAL is a SAP Cloud Application Programming Model(CAP) plugin that aims to improve and extend the standard validations provided. \n\nThis plugin aims to address the following:\n* Poor User Experience with default messages such as 'Value is required'. With a multilevel application with many mandatory fields this can leave the user feeling lost\n* Large handlers for custom validations/messages to address the above\n* Repetitive development implementing custom validations such as generating targets\n\n## Setup\nTo use CAPVAL, simply add the dependency to your project\n\n```sh\nnpm add capval\n```\n# Annotations\n## Custom Messages with contextual information\nTo override messages all we need to do is place the @validation.message annotation alongside existing input validation annotations \n### Examples\n#### Custom Message\n  \n  ```cds\n  db/validations.cds\n\n   using { sap.fe.cap.travel as schema } from '../db/schema';\n\n  annotate schema.Travel {\n      @validation.message: 'Enter a valid begin date'\n      @mandatory\n      BeginDate;\n  }\n```\n### Localisation \n Localisation is supported and dynamic contextual information can be provided.\n```cds\ndb/validations.cds\n\nusing { sap.fe.cap.travel as schema } from '../db/schema';\n\nannotate schema.Travel {\n    @validation.message: 'i18n>begindate-error'\n    @mandatory\n    BeginDate;\n}\n\n_i18n/i18n.properties\n\nbegindate-error = Enter a valid begin date\n\n  ```\n\n### Localisation with contextual information\n\n```cds\ndb/validations.cds\nusing { sap.fe.cap.travel as schema } from '../db/schema';\n\nannotate schema.Travel {\n    @validation.message: 'i18n>begindate-error'\n    @mandatory\n    BeginDate;\n}\n\n_i18n/i18n.properties\nbegindate-error = Begin Date required and must be before End Date {{Travel-EndDate}}\n   ```\n## Custom Validations \nThe introduced annotation @validation.handler allows a class to be specified that implements a custom validation. This allows for modulisation and reuse of validations. Implementations must extend the BaseValidation class and implement the IsValid Method, returning true or false. CAPVAL will automatically determine the targets (in/to_Booking(BookingUUID etc etc), collate, and return the errors. \n\n### Example \n#### Custom Validation\nThis handler checks that the begin date is before the end date\n```js\nsrv/handlers/BeginDateChecks.js\n\nconst BaseValidation = require(\"capval\");\nmodule.exports = class BeginDateChecks extends BaseValidation {\n  isValid(InputValue) {\n    var travel = this.getNode()\n\n    if (travel.BeginDate > travel.EndDate) {\n      return false\n    }\n\n    return true\n  }\n};\n```\n```cds\ndb/validations.cds\nusing { sap.fe.cap.travel as schema } from '../db/schema';\n\nannotate schema.Travel {\n    @validation: {\n        message: 'Please enter a begin date that is before the end date',\n        handler: 'srv/handlers/BeginDateChecks.js'\n    }\n   BeginDate;\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Advanced Scenario\nA generic conditional validation with dynamic error messages\n\n```js\nsrv/handlers/ConditionalMandatoryCheck.js\n\nconst BaseValidation = require('capval')\nmodule.exports = class ConditionalMandatoryCheck extends BaseValidation {\n    isValid(InputValue) {\n       var data = this.getDataToRoot()\n       if(data['Travel-TravelStatus_code'] === 'X') return true\n        if(!InputValue) {\n            this.seti18nMessage(this.getField()+ '-errorMessage')\n            return false\n        }\n        return true\n    }\n}\n```\n```cds\ndb/validations.cds\nusing { sap.fe.cap.travel as schema } from '../db/schema';\nannotate schema.Travel {\n    @validation: {\n        message: 'Default message',\n        handler: 'srv/handlers/ConditionalMandatoryCheck.js'\n    }\n   BeginDate;\n   @validation: {\n        message: 'Default message',\n        handler: 'srv/handlers/ConditionalMandatoryCheck.js'\n    }\n   EndDate;\n}\n\n_i18n/i18n.properties\nBeginDate-errorMessage = Please enter a valid begin date\nEndDate-errorMessage = Please enter a valid end date\n```\n#### Custom Data Scenario\nCustom Variables, that are not part of the Business Object can be added to provide information in messages.\n```js\nsrv/handlers/BeginDateChecks.js\n\nconst BaseValidation = require('capval')\nmodule.exports = class BeginDateChecks extends BaseValidation {\n    isValid(InputValue) {\n       var travel = this.getNode();\n       var today =(new Date).toISOString().slice(0,10)\n      \n       if(travel.BeginDate < today) {\n        this.seti18nMessage(\"begindatetoday-errorMessage\")\n        this.setCustomMessageVariables({ today: today})\n        return false\n       }\n      \n\n        return true\n    }\n}\n```\n```cds\ndb/validations.cds\nusing { sap.fe.cap.travel as schema } from '../db/schema';\nannotate schema.Travel {\n    @validation: {\n        message: 'Please enter a begin date that is before the end date',\n        handler: 'srv/handlers/BeginDateChecks.js'\n    }\n   BeginDate;\n}\n  \n_i18n/i18n.properties\nbegindatetoday-errorMessage = Travel Begin Date {{Travel-BeginDate}} can not be before today {{custom-today}}\n```\n\n### Methods\nThe following getter methods can be used to access information to assist with the validation:\n1. getField() : Returns the technical name of the Field getting validated. For Example: BeginDate\n2. getNode() :  Returns the Entity Data for which the Field is member of. For example: The Travel Instance\n3. getMessage() : Returns the annotated error message\n4. getTarget() : Returns the calculated target\n5. getDataToRoot(): Returns a flat JSON Object(keys prefixed with the Entity Name-) of the Node under validation as well as its parents to root\n6. getData(): Returns the full data(root with all ancestors) of the instance\n\nThe following setter methods are available:\n1. setMessage(Message): Overwrites the Error Message. Variables in double curly brackets can be provided\n2. seti18nMessage(Message): Overwrites the Error Message by providing a key for an entry in the i18n.properties file\n3. setTarget(Target): Overwrites the generated field target\n4. setCustomMessageVariables(data): Allows a JSON Object with custom key value pairs to be used in error messages\n\n## Demo\n\nSFLIGHT Scenario with CAPVAL\nhttps://github.com/MertSAP/cap-sflight\n\n\n\n\n",

            "readme": "# @gavdi/cap-batch - Batch Query Utils for CAP NodeJS\n\nA simple, yet effective way of batching requests from CAP to an OData API near you!\n\n## What's In The Box?\n\n`@gavdi/cap-batch` comes with a full query builder for when you want to send a large quantity of requests towards OData V2/4 APIs.\n\nThe package requires CAP version 7 or higher, and uses the built-in service structure from CAP to perform the HTTP queries towards your desired target.\n\n### Main Features\n\n- Easy batch request instantiation by supplying a CDS remote service instance to the constructor and then adding requests using Builder methodology.\n- Set the size of batch size. ie. SuccessFactors allows for max 180 calls in a batch at a time. Setting the page size to fx 50 in the constructor will make the tool recursively separate 100 request fx into 2 pages/$batch call and 110 into 3 etc.\n- Support for any valid target path. ie. also /upsert\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the package, you run the following command in your service layer root:\n\n```shell\nnpm i --save @gavdi/cap-batch\n```\n\nOnce installed, in your project you can then make use of it in your project.\n\nShould you want to use it with our recommended template for CAP, you can then make use of it through Dependency Injection, using the following setup:\n\n```typescript\n// service.ts - boostrapping\n...\n\nimport { BatchQueryBuilderFactory, DataServiceVersion } from \"@gavdi/cap-batch\";\n\n...\n\nexport default async (srv: Service) => {\n    ... // Default bootstrapping logic\n\n    await InitDIContainer([\n        {\n            id: \"sf.batchfactory\",\n            value: new BatchQueryBuilderFactory(\n                SuccessFactorsService,\n                DataServiceVersion.ODataV2\n            )\n        }\n    ]);\n\n    useContainer(Container);\n\n    ... // Default bootstrapping logic\n}\n\n// CustomLogic.ts - Your implementation\n...\nimport { BatchQueryBuilderFactory } from \"@gavdi/cap-batch\";\n\nclass CustomLogic {\n\n    @Inject(\"sf.batchfactory\")\n    public batchFactory: BatchQueryBuilderFactory\n\n    @OnRead()\n    public async YourOnReadMethod(@Req() req: Request): Promise<unknown> {\n        const batcher = batchFactory.createInstance(req);\n\n        // Your logic here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe advantage of using this setup is that you do not have to re-establish the service connection or store unnecessary variables locally for you to setup a batch builder.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe batch query builder is simple to use, and always returns what ever you input in the same order upon returning the result.\n\nIncluded in this package is also the types necessary for making sure that your data is returned exactly the way that you expect.\n\n> **NOTE: Currently it is NOT supported to have GET then POST then GET requests, please for now, add GET Requests first then the others - otherwise you cannot depend on the order responses come back out**\n\nSimple usage example:\n\n```typescript\n// Create/get your builder\nconst builder = new BatchQueryBuilder(req, service, 50, DataServiceVersion.ODataV2);\n\n// Construct some requests\nbuilder\n    // GET request\n    .addRequest({\n        path: \"/User\",\n        method: BatchMethod.GET,\n        contentType: BatchContentType.HTTP,\n    })\n    // PATCH request\n    .addRequest({\n        path: \"/Position(id='1234')\",\n        method: BatchMethod.PATCH,\n        contentType: BatchContentType.JSON,\n        data: {...}\n    })\n    // DELETE request\n    .addRequest({\n        path: \"/Information(id='1234')\",\n        method: BatchMethod.DELETE,\n        contentType: BatchContentType.HTTP,\n    })\n    // POST request\n    .addRequest({\n        path: \"/Random\",\n        method: BatchMethod.POST,\n        contentType: BatchContentType.HTTP,\n    });\n\n// Fire off the requests\nconst responses = await builder.fire<unknown>();\nif (!responses) {\n    throw new Error(\"Something went wrong!\");\n}\n\n// Parse/process your responses\nconst users = responses[0] as BatchResponse<User>;\nconst positions = responses[1] as BatchResponse<Position>;\nconst information = responses[2] as BatchResponse<Information>;\nconst random = responses[3] as BatchResponse<Random>;\n```\n\nFor even simpler cases where you just want to edit or get multiple at the same time of the same type,\nyou can simply use the `builder.fire<Type>()` type casting.\n\n## Resources\n\nWant to learn more about batch processing?

See [docs](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata02/os/complete/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-errata02-os-part1-protocol-complete.html#_Toc406398359)\n- [ ] Allow for adding url parameters to the $batch url. SF Allows for certain control params to be supplied ie.\n- [ ] Allow mixing the order of GETS and Changeset requests by fixing the order of responses to match it.\n\n---\n\n(c) Copyright by Gavdi Labs 2024 - All Rights Reserved\n",

            "readme": "# @gavdi/caplog - Easy CAP Logging Utility\n\n> Current Version: 2.0.0\n>\n> **NOTE:** This version contains breaking changes from the previous 1.0.1 version!\n>\n> @gavdi/caplog no longer makes use of any external logging component to integrate with the CAP environment.\n> This change has been made to ensure full compatability with telemetry offerings in the cloud environment.\n\n> Maintainer: Simon Laursen - svl@gavdilabs.com\n\n## How It Works\n\n```@gavdi/caplog``` is a small and tiny logging package that provides a simple and clean logging output to allow for better readability on BTP.\n\nIn the new 2.0 version of the logging package, the package abstracts away the logging facade native within CAP and provides type declarations.\n\nThe logger is intended for providing concise and clear information to the developer concerning their service, and with the new version now also through open telemetry.\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install the package, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save @gavdi/caplog\n```\n\nOnce NPM (or your package manager of choice) is done installing the dependency, you can then add a logger like so:\n\n```typescript\nimport { LoggerFactory } from \"@gavdi/caplog\";\n\n// Default logger\nLoggerFactory.createLogger();\n\n// Custom named logger\nLoggerFactory.createLogger(\"custom\");\n\n// Service bound logger\nLoggerFactory.createLogger(Service);\n```\n\nThe format you'll receive on your logged messages will look as follows:\n\n```txt\n[2024-01-03T11:42:38.045Z |::TRACE::| <tenant-id> | <ctx-id> | <log-id> ] Your message will be here\n[2024-01-03T11:42:38.045Z |::DEBUG::| <tenant-id> | <ctx-id> | <log-id> ] Your message will be here\n[2024-01-03T11:42:38.045Z |::INFO ::| <tenant-id> | <ctx-id> | <log-id> ] Your message will be here\n[2024-01-03T11:42:38.045Z |::WARN ::| <tenant-id> | <ctx-id> | <log-id> ] Your message will be here\n[2024-01-03T11:42:38.045Z |::ERROR::| <tenant-id> | <ctx-id> | <log-id> ] Your message will be here\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe logging component can be configured using the following:\n\n1. In the service' environment, add the environment variable ```LOG_LEVEL``` and set the desired level at which the logger should operate. Options are:\n    - ```TRACE``` - Outputs all possible loggings to the application log\n    - ```DEBUG``` - Outputs debug level logs and above to the application log\n    - ```INFO``` - Only outputs info logs and above to the application console\n    - ```WARN``` - Only outputs warning logs and above to the application console\n    - ```ERROR``` - Only outputs error logs to the application console\n    - ```SILENT``` - No output to the application console, i.e. no visible trace of any internal logs\n2. When creating the logger instance, a custom format can be setup.\n   This format is specifically tied to the logger that you create at that point in time.\n    - Example:\n        ```typescript\n        // Creating and formatting the new logger\n        import { LoggerFactory } from \"@gavdi/caplog\";\n\n        const logger = LoggerFactory.createInstance(\"custom-format\", (id: string, level: number, ...args) => [\n            `[${(new Date).toISOString()}]`,\n            `[${level}]`,\n            `[${id}]`,\n            \" -> \",\n            ..args\n        ]);\n\n        logger.trace(\"Your message\", \"will be here\");\n        ```\n        ```shell\n        -- output\n        [2024-01-03T11:42:38.045Z][5][<log-id>] -> Your message will be here\n        ```\n        Internally the log levels are translated from numbers  into text using a dictionary.\n        This dictionary can be utilized through the utility function ```translateLogLevel(logLevel)```.\n\n## API\n\nTo provide the safest and easiest logging utility out there, this neat little package only comes with the following API:\n\n### LoggerFactory Methods\n\n| Method              | Parameters             | Description                                                       |\n|---------------------|----------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Logger.createLogger | relation = cds.Service or string | Creates new logger instance. Relation input is optional | \n\n\n### Logger Methods\n\n| Method              | Parameters             | Description                                                       |\n|---------------------|----------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Logger.trace | args = unlimited input of any type | Log trace level message |\n| Logger.debug | args = unlimited input of any type | Log debug level message |\n| Logger.info  | args = unlimited input of any type | Log info level message  | \n| Logger.warn  | args = unlimited input of any type | Log warn level message  | \n| Logger.error | args = unlimited input of any type | Log error level message  | \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n(c) Copyright by Gavdi Labs 2024 - All Rights Reserved\n\n",

You can add and combine all valid [Faker module APIs](https://fakerjs.dev/api/).\n\n```js\n// db/schema.cds\n\nentity Customers : cuid, managed {\n  name       String  @Mockdata: {person: 'fullName'};\n  sex        String  @Mockdata: {person: 'sex'};\n  creditCard String  @Mockdata: {finance: 'creditCardNumber'};\n  phone      String  @Mockdata: {phone: 'number'};\n  ipAddress  String  @Mockdata: {internet: 'ipv4'};\n  email      String  @Mockdata: {internet: 'email'};\n  street     String  @Mockdata: {location: 'streetAddress'};\n  country    String  @Mockdata: {location: 'countryCode'};\n};\n```\n\n### Using\n\nOnce you have installed the plugin and added the annotations, or not, you can execute the following command in a terminal:\n\n```shell\ncds add mockdata\n```\n\nThe `cds add mockdata` command will create CSV files for every supported CDS Entity. The CSV files will be created into the `db/data` folder, the filenames will be something like `namespace-entityName.csv` and their content will look like:\n\n|ID                                  |createdAt                                                 |createdBy      |modifiedAt                                                |modifiedBy             |name              |sex   |creditCard              |phone              |ipAddress      |email                        |street             |country                |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n|bef3c7b8-1232-4860-bded-efd51443e508|Sun Oct 06 2024 15:55:24 GMT-0300 (Brasilia Standard Time)|Julius_Hintz48 |Sun Nov 03 2024 14:38:56 GMT-0300 (Brasilia Standard Time)|Brain_Mosciski         |Edgar Langosh     |female|3564-4519-0923-7387     |801.226.6645 x01258|214.155.102.159|Marcellus.Fritsch@hotmail.com|640 Bramley Close  |Austria                |\n|96ac7211-691a-4c2a-8fc0-0ae509693193|Thu Mar 28 2024 20:32:35 GMT-0300 (Brasilia Standard Time)|Clotilde_DAmore|Thu Nov 23 2023 10:49:44 GMT-0300 (Brasilia Standard Time)|Brendan.Corwin-Schinner|Erica McDermott   |male  |6567-6280-8822-5389-0611|(240) 938-1223     |37.230.118.100 |Shayne78@gmail.com           |1803 Feeney Park   |Cocos (Keeling) Islands|\n|4fc525bc-e22b-4c55-a447-0e4c9fef1ffd|Fri Feb 09 2024 15:21:45 GMT-0300 (Brasilia Standard Time)|Lance78        |Fri Feb 14 2025 05:25:29 GMT-0300 (Brasilia Standard Time)|Donny_Blanda           |Joseph Lehner     |male  |4686210527760           |312-939-7109       |14.207.231.127 |Daija_Oberbrunner94@gmail.com|79422 Collin Divide|Portugal               |\n|872b47a8-0bb1-47af-bc02-ef7290cff633|Sat Feb 22 2025 01:34:16 GMT-0300 (Brasilia Standard Time)|Mateo22        |Sun Sep 15 2024 18:42:41 GMT-0300 (Brasilia Standard Time)|Myrtle52               |Leigh Wintheiser I|male  |6759-2563-9161-5976     |553.277.9724 x231  |10.88.166.234  |Elyssa.Adams79@gmail.com     |139 Park Drive     |Macao                  |\n",

The plugin *does not support any authentication flow*, but the mapping of Entra ID artefacts to CAP roles for declarative authorization.\n\n## Requirements\n\n:exclamation: Your CAP app must be protected by [OAuth 2.0 authorization with Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/architecture/auth-oauth2), configured via the `App Service` → `Settings` → `Authentication`\n\nBoth `Entra ID Groups` (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/optional-claims#configure-groups-optional-claims) and `App roles` https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/develop/configure-tokens-group-claims-app-roles  are supported to be subsequentially used for annotation in CDS files.\n\n## Installation + Configuration\n\n```shell\nnpm i --save cds-entra-id\n```\n\nThen tell your CAP app to use this plugin (see https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-env#sources-for-cds-env for possible config file locations and configuration options).\n\nE.g. in `./.cdsrc.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"requires\": {\n    \"auth\": {\n      \"[development]\": { // <-- let's keep local dev as is\n        \"kind\": \"mocked\"\n      },\n      \"[production]\": { // <-- grow as you go when deployed to Azure\n        \"impl\": \"cds-entra-id\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor Debugging purposes, you can set the enviornment variable `DEBUG=cds-entra-id` as with [all CAP `DEBUG` options](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-log#debug-env-variable).\n\n## Usage\n\nAnnotate your `.cds` services as usual:\n\n```cds\nservice its {\n    @(requires: 'authenticated-user')\n    function ok() returns String;\n    @(requires: ['7b428506-466b-45b0-9cbf-4e1b20734874', 'test-app-role'])\n    function nok() returns String;\n}\n```\n\nThe function import `ok()` requires any authenticated user, no matter the role or group.\n\nHowever, `nok()` requires the logged in user \n\n- to be a member of the `Entra ID` group '7b428506-466b-45b0-9cbf-4e1b20734874' or\n- a member of the `App role` 'test-app-role'.\n\nWhy a GUID for an Entra ID group and not a regular name? Entra ID passes out group memberships only as GUIDs in order to prevent wrongful impersonation. As the note on https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims explains: \n\n> \"a group name is not unique, and display names can only be emitted for groups explicitly assigned to the application to reduce the security risks. Otherwise, any user could create a group with duplicate name and gain access in the application side.\"\n\nThe same website also states:\n\n> When you're using group membership for in-application authorization, it's preferable to use the group `ObjectID` attribute. The group `ObjectID` attribute is immutable and unique in Microsoft Entra ID. It's available for all groups.\n\nAnd that's why `cds-entra-id` supports GUIDs for Entra ID group authorizations.\n\nThe `App roles` are app-specific (and not valid Entra ID-wide). They are relayed as regular names and can be used as such for CDS annotations.\n\n## Under the hood :blue_car:\n\nThe plugin parses the OAuth 2.0 claims into proper CAP User objects.\n\nAdditionally, it has no Node.js module dependencies - yay.\n\n## Contributing\n\n:computer: hack away and PR!\n\n- please use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so the changelog can be auto-generated. Their usage here is guarded by :dog: [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/).\n- please format the code w/ [Prettier](https://prettier.io). A `.prettierrc` is in the repo.\n\n## License\n\nThis work is dual-licensed under Apache 2.0 and the Derived Beer-ware 🍺 License.

            "readme": "# SAP CAP SDM Plugin\n\nA plugin made for SAP Cloud Application Programming (CAP) projects, aimed at effortless integration with SAP Document Management Service (SDM). Achieve smooth connections in a 'CAP-ish' style, solely utilizing CDS Annotations. This makes your DMS integrations simpler and more intuitive.\n\n## Project Overview\n\n`sap-cap-sdm-plugin` is a CDS plugin that provides integration to the SAP Document Management service specifically for CAP projects.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo use the all-in-one features provided by this plugin, you'll need a paid instance of the [SAP Document Management service](https://help.sap.com/docs/document-management-service?locale=en-US).\n\n## Installation & Setup\n\n### 1. Installation\n\nInstall the plugin using npm with the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install sap-cap-sdm-plugin\n```\n\n### 2. Configuration\n\nInclude the plugin in the `cds.requires` section of your `package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"cds\": {\n    \"requires\": {\n        \"sap-cap-sdm-plugin\": {\n            \"impl\": \"sap-cap-sdm-plugin\",\n            \"settings\": {\n                \"destination\": \"<YOUR_SDM_DESTINATION_NAME>\",\n                \"repositoryId\": \"<YOUR_REPOSITORY_ID>\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n},\n```\n\n### 3. Entity Creation\n\nSet up your entity with the `@Sdm.Entity` annotation. Link your entity properties to CMIS properties using the `@Sdm.Field` annotations:\n\n```cds\nservice SampleService {\n    @cds.persistence.skip\n    @Sdm.Entity\n    entity Files {\n        key id           : String      @Sdm.Field      : { type : 'property', path : 'cmis:objectId' };\n            name         : String      @Sdm.Field      : { type : 'property', path : 'cmis:name' };\n            content      : LargeBinary @Core.MediaType : contentType  @Core.ContentDisposition.Filename : name;\n            contentType  : String      @Core.IsMediaType\n                                       @Sdm.Field      : { type : 'property', path : 'cmis:contentStreamMimeType' };\n            createdBy    : String      @Sdm.Field      : { type : 'property', path : 'cmis:createdBy' };\n            creationDate : Date        @Sdm.Field      : { type : 'property', path : 'cmis:creationDate' };\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Get Started\n\nAfter setting up, check your configuration to make sure everything is okay.\n\n## Additional Features\n\n1. File URL\n\nObtain a direct URL to the document by specifying `type: 'link'` within the `@Sdm.Field` annotation.\n\n```cds\n    url: String @Sdm.Field : { type : 'link' };\n```\n\n2. CMIS Client\n\nIf the entity annotations don't meet your needs, you can use the CMIS Client to implement your own logic.\n\nThis service follows the specs of [SAP Document Management Service, Integration Options - CMIS](https://api.sap.com//package/SAPDocumentManagementServiceIntegrationOptionCMISAPI/rest) from [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/).\n\n### Usage:\n\n```javascript\nconst client = await cds.connect.to('cmis-client');\n// create a folder in root\nawait client\n  .createFolder('your_repository_id', 'folder_name')\n  .execute(destination);\n```\n\nCheck `test/cmis` for more examples.\n\n3. SDM Administrative Operations\n\nThere's also a service for admin tasks, like adding a new repository. This service comes from the [Document Management Service, Integration Options - AdminAPI](https://api.sap.com/api/AdminAPI/overview).\n\n### Usage:\n\n```javascript\nconst admin = await cds.connect.to('sdm-admin');\n\n// add a new repository\nawait admin.onboardARepository({\n  repository: {\n    displayName: 'sdm-plugin',\n    description: 'sdm-plugin',\n    repositoryType: 'internal',\n    isVersionEnabled: 'false',\n  },\n});\n```\n\nCheck `test/admin` for more examples.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis is an early release, so some SAP DMS features are not yet supported, including:\n\n- Repositories with `isVersionEnabled` set to true;\n- Repositories with `isThumbnailEnabled` set to true;\n- Bulk upload;\n- Bulk download;\n",

Ensure you have the latest LTS version of Node.js installed (see [Getting Started](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/))\n2. Install [**@sap/cds-dk**](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/) globally:\n\n   ```sh\n   npm i -g @sap/cds-dk\n   ```\n\n3. _Optional:_ [Use Visual Studio Code](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/tools#vscode)\n\n### Download\n\nIf you've [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed, clone this repo as shown below, otherwise [download as ZIP file](archive/main.zip).\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/sap-samples/cloud-cap-samples samples\ncd samples\n```\n\n### Setup\n\nIn the samples folder run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Run\n\nWith that you're ready to run the samples, for example:\n\n```sh\ncds watch bookshop\n```\n\nAfter that open this link in your browser: [http://localhost:4004](http://localhost:4004)\n\nWhen asked to log in, type `alice` as user and leave the password field blank, which is the [default user](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/authentication#mocked).\n\n### Testing\n\nRun the provided tests with [_jest_](http://jestjs.io) or [_mocha_](http://mochajs.org), for example:\n\n```sh\nnpx jest\n```\n> While mocha is a bit smaller and faster, jest runs tests in parallel and isolation, which allows to run all tests.\n\n## Code Tours\n\nTake one of the [guided tours](.tours) in VS Code through our CAP samples and learn which CAP features are showcased by the different parts of the repository. Just install the [CodeTour extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) for VS Code. We'll add more code tours in the future. Stay tuned!\n\n## Get Support\n\nCheck out the documentation at [https://cap.cloud.sap](https://cap.cloud.sap). <br>\nIn case you've a question, find a bug, or otherwise need support, use our [community](https://answers.sap.com/tags/9f13aee1-834c-4105-8e43-ee442775e5ce) to get more visibility.\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

            "readme": "# Welcome to the CAP SFLIGHT App\n\nThis is a sample app for the travel reference scenario, built with the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap) and [SAP Fiori Elements](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/smart-templates).\n\nThe purpose of this sample app is to:\n* Demonstrate SAP Fiori annotations\n* Demonstrate and compare SAP Fiori features on various stacks (CAP Node.js, CAP Java SDK, ABAP)\n* Run UI test suites on various stacks\n\n![Process Travels Page](img.png)\n\nThe app still contains some workarounds that are going to be addressed over time.\nIn some cases, the model and the handlers can be improved or simplified once further planned CAP features become available.\nIn other cases, the app itself could be improved. For example, calculation of the total price for a travel\ncurrently simply sums up the single prices ignoring the currencies.\n\n> For enabling all features of the Analytical List Page (ALP) in the Node.js runtime, we have switched on the new OData parser \n(`odata_new_parser: true` in `package.json`), which is still in an **experimental state**.\nEarly adopters may use this feature in own projects on their own risk.\nYou can also use the ALP with the standard OData parser, but then some features like grouping in the table are not available.\n\n![](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cap-sflight/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/cap-sflight)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/cap-sflight)\n\n\n## Run locally\n\n### Build and Run - Node.js Backend\n\nIn the root folder of your project, run\n```\nnpm ci\ncds watch\n```\n\n### Build and Run - Java Backend\n\nIn the root folder of your project, run\n```\nnpm ci\nmvn spring-boot:run\n```\n\n### Accessing the SAP Fiori Apps\n\nOpen these links in your browser:\n* http://localhost:4004/travel_processor/webapp/index.html for processing the travel data\n* http://localhost:4004/travel_analytics/webapp/index.html for the [Analytical List Page](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/3d33684b08ca4490b26a844b6ce19b83) (ALP)\n\nLog in with user `amy` and empty password.\n\n### Integration Tests\n\nTo start OPA tests, open this link in your browser:\nhttp://localhost:4004/travel_processor/webapp/test/integration/Opa.qunit.html\n\nTest documentation is available at:\nhttps://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.fe.test\n\n## Deployment to SAP Business Technology Platform\n\nThe project contains a configuration for deploying the CAP services and the SAP Fiori app to the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) using a managed application router. The app then becomes visible in the content manager of the SAP Launchpad service.\n\nThe configuration file `mta.yaml` is for the Node.js backend of the app. If you want to deploy the Java backend, copy `mta-java.yaml` to `mta.yaml`.\n\n### Prerequisites\n#### SAP Business Technology Platform\n\n- Create a [trial account on SAP BTP](https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform/trial.html). See this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) for more information. Alternatively, you can use a sub-account in a productive environment.\n- Subscribe to the [SAP Launchpad Service](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html).\n- Create an [SAP HANA Cloud Service instance](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-app-hana-cloud-setup.html#08480ec0-ac70-4d47-a759-dc5cb0eb1d58) or use an existing one.\n\n#### Local Machine\n\n- Install the Cloud Foundry command line interface (CLI). See this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html) for more details.\n- Install the [MultiApps CF CLI Plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin):\n\n  ```shell\n  cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org\n  cf install-plugin multiapps\n  ```\n\n- Install the [Cloud MTA Build Tool](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool) globally:\n\n  ```shell\n  npm install -g mbt\n   ```\n\n### Build the Project\n\nBuild the project from the command line:\n\n```shell\nmbt build\n```\n\nThe build results will be stored in the directory `mta_archives`.\n\n### Deploy\n\n1. Log in to the target space.\n2. Deploy the MTA archive using the CF CLI: `cf deploy mta_archives/capire.sflight_1.0.0.mtar`\n\n### Assign Role Collection\n\nAny authorized user has read access to the app. For further authorization, assign a role collection to your user in the SAP BTP Cockpit:\n* `sflight-reviewer-{spacename}` for executing actions *Accept Travel*, *Reject Travel*, and *Deduct Discount*\n* `sflight-processor-{spacename}` for full write access\n\n### Integrate SFlight with SAP Build Workzone, Standard Edition\n\nCAP SFlight uses the managed AppRouter, which in case of a trial account, is provided by the Launchpad Service in SAP Build Workzone, Standard Edition. Please consult [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/integrate-with-work-zone.html) to make sure that your Launchpad Service is configured correctly to serve the CAP SFlight Frontend.\n\n### Local Development with a HANA Cloud Instance\n\nYou need to have access to a HANA Cloud instance and SAP BTP.\n\n1. Deploy the HDI content to a HANA HDI container (which is newly created on first call): `cds deploy --to hana`.\n2. Start the application with the Spring Profile `cloud`.\n   1. From Maven: `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=cloud`\n   2. From your IDE with the JVM argument `-Dspring.profiles.active=cloud` or env variable `spring.profiles.active=cloud`\n\nThe running application is now connected to its own HDI container/schema. Please keep in mind that the credentials for\nthat HDI container are stored locally on your filesystem (default-env.json).\n\n## Deployment to SAP Business Technology Platform - Kyma Runtime\n\nThe deployment to Kyma Runtime is explained in file [README-Kyma-Runtime.md](./README-Kyma-Runtime.md).\n\n## Creating an SAP Fiori App from Scratch\n\nIf you want to implement an SAP Fiori app, follow these tutorials:\n\n* [Create a List Report Object Page App with SAP Fiori Tools](https://developers.sap.com/group.fiori-tools-lrop.html)\n* [Developing SAP Fiori applications with SAP Fiori Tools](https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US)\n\n## Get Support\n\nIn case you've a question, find a bug, or otherwise need support, use the [SAP Community](https://answers.sap.com/tags/9f13aee1-834c-4105-8e43-ee442775e5ce) to get more visibility.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

            "readme": "# ui5-cap-event-app\n\n[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-cap-event-app)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-cap-event-app)\n\nShowcase of two UI5 user interfaces, one built with freestyle [SAPUI5](https://ui5.sap.com/) (or rather [OpenUI5](https://openui5.org/)), the other using [SAP Fiori elements](https://community.sap.com/topics/fiori-elements), with a [CAP](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) backend, using [OData V4](https://www.odata.org/) with [Draft mode](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/draft-handling/).\n\n## Description\n\nThis app uses simple attendee registration and administration for events as an example scenario for demonstrating the data handling and overall setup. The app consists of three parts: an end-user UI implemented in freestyle SAPUI5, a metadata-driven administrator UI generated with Fiori elements and a Node.js-based CAP backend.\nWhile the code implements a complete end-to-end full-stack app, it is kept as simple as possible and the main focus is on freestyle SAPUI5 code making use of OData V4 as well as of \"Draft\" functionality to persist non-final datasets.\n\nFurther details about how the functionality is implemented can be found [in the documentation](docs/documentation.md).\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (latest LTS version which supports npm workspaces)\n- [SAP CAP CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-dk) (do `npm install -g @sap/cds-dk`)\n- [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org) (only needed separately on Windows, [commandline tools](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) zip need to be downloaded, extracted, and directory added to the PATH)\n\n## Download and Installation\n\n1. Clone the project.\n\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-cap-event-app\n    cd ui5-cap-event-app\n    ```\n\n2. Use npm to install the dependencies.\n\n    ```sh\n    npm i\n    ```\n\n## Running the Project\n\nExecute the following command to run the project locally for development (start the CDS server running the admin UI and form UI embedded):\n\n```sh\nnpm start\n```\n\nAs also shown in the terminal after executing this command, the CDS server is running on http://localhost:4004/.\n\nFor the form UI, you can use user name `employee@test.com` with password `123`. For the admin UI, use `admin@test.com` and password `123`.\n\n## Building the Project\n\nExecute the following command to build the project and get one integrated app that can be deployed (build the form UI, admin UI, and CDS server):\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\n**Prerequisite:** `npm run build` runs `cds build` in the CDS server package which requires `@sap/cds-dk`. Please ensure to install `@sap/cds-dk` globally via:\n```sh\nnpm i -g @sap/cds-dk\n```\n\nAfter building the individual packages, the build results will be copied to the central `dist` folder. The resulting package inside the `dist` folder consists of the CDS server hosting the form UI and the admin UI as well as a sandbox Fiori launchpad to start the individual UIs.\n\nTo start the generated package, just run `npm install` and `npm start` inside the `dist` folder. This installs the dependencies and starts the CDS server hosting the UIs. Now the sandbox Fiori launchpad can be opened on http://localhost:4004/.\n\n## Debugging the Project\n\nWe have prepared two ways of debugging the Node.js part of the app easily:\n\n### Debugging with VSCode\n\nThe launch configuration \"debug server in vscode\" is part of the project and can be used to run the CAP server in debug mode and debug directly in VSCode (e.g. set breakpoints).\n\nNote: the UI parts are not started by this launch configuration. To debug the interaction of server and UI, the form UI or admin UI has to be started separately with `npm run start:ui-form` or `npm run start:ui-admin`.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe local database uses in-memory mode. Data will be re-initialized after each restart.\n\nThe sample does not cover deployment of the app, where additional considerations e.g. regarding database and authentication are needed.\n\n## How to obtain support\n\nThe sample code is provided **as-is**. No support is provided.\n\n## References\n\nOther projects demonstrating similar use-cases:\n\n* https://github.com/vobu/ui5-cap - a repository showcasing the use of UI5 Tooling, CAP + UIveri5-based testing in an app for media upload and preview (as presented at UI5conBE in Feb 2020) by Volker Buzek.\n* https://blogs.sap.com/2020/07/08/ui5-freestyle-app-in-cap - a UI5 freestyle app in CAP, with approuter, by Wouter Lemaire.\n* https://blogs.sap.com/2020/09/06/developing-a-fiori-elements-app-with-cap-and-fiori-tools/ - about developing a Fiori elements app with CAP and Fiori Tools\n* https://blogs.sap.com/2020/04/07/ui5-tooling-a-modern-development-experience-for-ui5/ - an overview on the UI5 Tooling and its extensions for a modern development experience.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2020-2023 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

For the latest sample code repositories, visit the [SAP Samples](https://github.com/SAP-samples) organization.\n\n# Full Stack TypeScript App\n\nThis sample project is a full stack application for the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment that utilizes the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) for Node.js and SAPUI5 with TypeScript.\n\n[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a superset of JavaScript, which can essentially be described as JavaScript with syntax for types. The additionally added syntax allows a better editor integration and aims to catch errors early in development.\n\nThis project shows a full stack app entirely build with TypeScript. It is based on a basic lecture schedule scenario. The backend service features a simple data model (Rooms, Professors, Courses, Lectures) and provides data to populate a lecture schedule, which is displayed as a planning calendar on the frontend. Users can either view or manage the lecture schedule depending on the roles that are assigned to them.\n\n![diagram](diagram.png)\n\n**UI5 TypeScript Frontend**: A freestyle SAPUI5 app serves as the frontend for the project. Component, Controller, and Formatter are implemented using the perks of TypeScript. If you want to learn more about TypeScript with UI5, have a look at the following resources:\n\n-   [Getting Started with TypeScript for UI5 Application Development](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/07/01/getting-started-with-typescript-for-ui5-application-development/)\n-   [Central entry point for everything TypeScript-related in SAPUI5/OpenUI5](https://sap.github.io/ui5-typescript/)\n-   [UI5 TypeScript Hello World App](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld)\n\n**CAP TypeScript Backend**: The backend service is implemented with CAP Node.js. TypeScript is used to write the service handler for the lecture service. A tsconfig.json file is used to define TypeScript compiler options and configuration. You can find more on using TypeScript with CAP here:\n\n-   [CAP Node.js SDK - Using TypeScript](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/typescript)\n-   [Hello World! TypeScript sample](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples/tree/main/hello)\n\nFor a more detailed description of the sample app and takeaways when using TypeScript, please take a look at the accompanying **blog post**: [Full Stack TypeScript App for Cloud Foundry - Sample Repository](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/12/09/full-stack-typescript-app-for-cloud-foundry-sample-repository)\n\n## Requirements\n\n-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) LTS Version 14\n-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management\n-   install [@sap/cds-dk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-dk) globally\n-   install [@ui5/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/cli) globally\n\n## Download and Installation\n\n1. Clone the project:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-full-stack-typescript-app.git\ncd btp-full-stack-typescript-app\n```\n\n(or download from https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-full-stack-typescript-app/archive/main.zip)\n\n2. In the btp-full-stack-typescript-app folder, use npm (or yarn) to install the dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\n3. In the app/lectures sub-folder, use npm (or yarn) to install the dependencies:\n\n```sh\ncd app/lectures\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Run, Build and Deploy the App\n\n> `npm run start` is for production purposes and **not intended to be used on your local machine**. Since TypeScript code itself cannot be executed, a transpile step to JavaScript is needed before running the project. Choose one of the following options instead to run the app.\n\n### Run the App locally\n\n```sh\nnpm run start-service:ts\n```\n\nThe service is now available at http://localhost:4004.\n\n```sh\nnpm run start-ui:ts\n```\n\nThe UI5 app is now running on http://localhost:8080/index.html (a browser window with this URL opens automatically).\n\nFor local development with **mock authentication** use one of the following **users** to test the app:\n| ID | password |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| _admin_ | _initial_ |\n| _viewer_ | _initial_ |\n\n### Run the App locally in watch mode\n\n```sh\nnpm run watch\n```\n\nThis starts a local development server in watch mode. Changes to files (including the uncompiled TypeScript resources) are automatically detected and applied. The CAP service is now available at http://localhost:4004 (a browser window with this URL opens automatically to show the generic index.html page), and the UI5 app can be accessed at http://localhost:4004/webapp/index.html.\n\nFor local development with **mock authentication** use one of the following **users** to test the app:\n| ID | password |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| _admin_ | _initial_ |\n| _viewer_ | _initial_ |\n\n### Build the MTA and Deploy to Cloud Foundry\n\n> Additional preparation steps and tools are required to deploy the application to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment. For more information and guidance on the initial setup, please have a look at these tutorials and resources:\n>\n> -   [Create a trial account on SAP BTP](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html)\n> -   [Create SAP HANA Cloud Service instance](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-app-hana-cloud-setup.html#08480ec0-ac70-4d47-a759-dc5cb0eb1d58)\n> -   [Install Cloud Foundry CLI](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html)\n> -   [Install MultiApps CF CLI Plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin)\n> -   [Install Cloud MTA Build Tool](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/download/)\n\n```sh\nmbt build -t ./\n```\n\n```sh\ncf login\ncf deploy lecture-schedule_1.0.0.mtar\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\n-   The local database uses in-memory mode. Data will be re-initialized after each restart.\n-   The provided sample data only covers a specific timeframe (CW47/2021 to CW05/2022)\n-   The user role check for UI adjustments is based on the standalone approuter and BTP roles. Therefore it is not available when running the app locally.\n\n## Known Issues\n\nNone at the moment.\n\n## How to obtain Support\n\nThis content is provided \"as-is\" with no other support.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

Specifically, the Node.js flavor of CAP is used.\n\nDuring this event, you'll become acquainted with how external services can be integrated and consumed from within a CAP project. In working through the exercises you'll also become comfortable with various facilities that CDS offers for declaring, relating and exposing entities, and familiar with how the SAP Cloud SDK covers connectivity and destinations, supporting such integration scenarios with CAP.\n\n## Session prerequisites\n\nIn order to get the most from this CodeJam, and to be able to work through the exercises, there are certain prerequisites that you must have sorted out before the day of the CodeJam.\n\nThe prerequisites are detailed in a separate [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file. Please ensure you have everything ready before attending the CodeJam.\n\n## Exercises\n\nThese are the exercises, each in their own directory, sometimes with supporting files and scripts. We will work through the exercises in the order shown here. From a session flow perspective, we are taking the \"coordinated\" approach:\n\nThe instructor will set you off on the first exercise, and that's the only one you should do; if you finish before others, there are some questions at the end of the exercise for you to ponder. Do not proceed to the next exercise until the instructor tells you to do so.\n\n> The exercises are written in a conversational way; this is so that they have enough context and information to be completed outside the hands-on session itself. To help you navigate and find what you have to actually do next, there are pointers like this 👉 throughout that indicate the things you have to actually do (as opposed to just read for background information).\n\n1. [Set up your workspace](exercises/01-set-up-workspace/)\n1. [Explore the basic service](exercises/02-explore-basic-service/)\n1. [Import an OData service definition](exercises/03-import-odata-api/)\n1. [Understand service mocking](exercises/04-understand-service-mocking/)\n1. [Add test data for the mocked external service](exercises/05-add-test-data/)\n1. [Mock external service in a separate process](exercises/06-mock-separate-process/)\n1. [Add CDS definitions to integrate services](exercises/07-add-cds-definitions/)\n1. [Introduce SAP Cloud SDK](exercises/08-introduce-sap-cloud-sdk/)\n1. [Set up the real remote system configuration](exercises/09-set-up-remote-system-configuration/)\n1. [Run the service with real remote delegation](exercises/10-run-with-real-remote-delegation/)\n1. [Associate local and remote entities](exercises/11-associate-local-remote-entities/)\n1. [Extend the SAP Fiori elements UI with annotations](exercises/12-extend-fiori-ui-with-annotations)\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you can spare a couple of minutes at the end of the session, please help us improve for next time by providing some feedback.\n\nSimply use this [Give Feedback](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cap-service-integration-codejam/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=session-feedback-template.md&title=Session%20Feedback) link to create a special \"feedback\" issue, and follow the instructions in there.\n\nThank you!\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe exercise content in this repository is based on previous work for an SAP TechEd 2 hour workshop, written by Christian Georgi of the CAP team.\n\n## How to obtain support\n\nSupport for the content in this repository is available during the actual time of the CodeJam event for which this content has been designed.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.

            "readme": "# Sample ToDo app UI5con 2022\n\n## Description\n\nThis app demonstrates a TypeScript setup for developing UI5 applications containing a custom UI5 Library with a custom control and a CAP project as a backend.\n\n**The ui package is inspired by the [`SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld`](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld) project which  also contains [a detailed step-by-step guide](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-helloworld/blob/main/step-by-step.md). It explains how this setup is created and how all the bits and pieces fit together**\n\n| :point_up: Overview of TypeScript-related Entities |\n|:---------------------------|\n| The UI5 type definitions (`*.d.ts` files) are loaded as dev dependency from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openui5/ts-types-esm). They are work in progress, so while they should be working well already, we are still improving them, which might also lead to breaking changes. |\n| The file [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) contains the configuration for the TypeScript compilation, including a reference to these UI5 `*.d.ts` files. |\n| Normally, the UI5 JavaScript files (controllers, Component.js etc.) would reside in the `webapp` folder. Now they are in the [src](src) folder. The TypeScript compilation will create the `webapp` folder and put all output there. |\n| In addition to the TypeScript compilation, there is also a conversion from the ES6 module and class syntax used in the source files to the classic UI5 module loading and class definition syntax (`sap.ui.define(...)` and `superClass.extend(...)`). This conversion is using the [babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5](https://github.com/r-murphy/babel-plugin-transform-modules-ui5) project from Ryan Murphy. |\n| Both, the TypeScript compilation and the ES6 syntax transformation, are executed by Babel, as configured in the file [.babelrc.json](.babelrc.json) |\n| This combined transformation is triggered by both the `build:ts` and `watch:ts` scripts in [package.json](package.json). |\n\n## Project setup\nPNPM as package manager for monorepo\n\nSeparate packages for:\n - UI5 application: packages/ui/\n - UI5 library: packages/library/\n - CAP server: packages/server/\n\nCAP server is proxied by UI5 application\n\nUI5 application depends on the UI5 library project which is consumed as regular dependency\n\n![Project setup Image](./images/project.png)\n\n## UI setup\nThis UI app demonstrates on how to get the most out of TypeScript using classes, generic types and much more. This is all explained in details in the following blog post: https://blogs.sap.com/2021/12/07/my-first-experience-with-typescript-in-ui5-classes-and-state-model-manager/\n\nThe app is separated in multiple layers:\n - Service layer which handles the communication to the backend\n - Data model layer which contains a virtual replication of the data model in the backend and handles everything related to the internal data model\n - View/controller will be dedicated to handle user interaction\n\n![UI setup image](./images/ui-structure.png)\n\n## UI Library\nMore information regarding custom UI5 Libraries and custom controls can be found here: https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-typescript-control-library\n\n## Testing\nThe end-to-end tests are done by using WDI5: https://github.com/ui5-community/wdi5\n\n## Requirements\n\n[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for dependency management.\n\n## Preparation\n\nUse `npm` to install the dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm i\n```\n\n## Run the App\n\nExecute the following command to run the app locally for development in watch mode (the browser reloads the app automatically when there are changes in the source code):\n\n```sh\nnpm start\n```\n\nAs shown in the terminal after executing this command, the app is then running on http://localhost:8080/index.html. A browser window with this URL should automatically open.\n\n## Debug the App\n\nIn the browser, you can directly debug the original TypeScript code, which is supplied via sourcemaps (need to be enabled in the browser's developer console if it does not work straight away). If the browser doesn't automatically jump to the TypeScript code when setting breakpoints, use e.g. Ctrl+P in Chrome to open the `*.ts` file you want to debug.\n\n## Build the App\n\nExecute the following command to build all packages at once:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## References\n\nOnce you have understood the setup and want to inspect the code of a slightly more comprehensive UI5 app written in TypeScript, you can check out the [TypeScript version of the UI5 CAP Event App Sample](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-cap-event-app/tree/typescript).\n\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache Software License, version 2.0 except as noted otherwise in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.\n"

See [this blog post](https://github.com/htammen/cap-vscode-dev-container#so-what-do-i-have-to-do) for details.  \nIf you don't have Docker installed **you can of course develop within you local OS**. But in that case you have to install all your tools and vs extensions on your own.\n\n## Preliminaries\n\n- get [_Node.js_](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16 or higher\n- get [_sqlite_](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) (Windows only; pre-installed on Mac/Linux)\n- As SAP has deprecated their own NPM registry please remove the setting in your npm config with the following command\n\n```sh\nnpm config rm @sap:registry\n```\n\n## Setup\n\nCopy & paste this to your command line:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/gregorwolf/bookshop-demo.git\ncd bookshop-demo\nnpm install\nnpm run setup\n```\n\n## Run local\n\nIf you want to try also the external service calls, then you need to create a `default-env.json` file in the project root folder and add the following content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"destinations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"ES5\",\n      \"url\": \"https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com\",\n      \"username\": \"<your-ES5-username>\",\n      \"password\": \"<your-ES5-password>\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"ERP\",\n      \"url\": \"https://saperp.example.com\",\n      \"username\": \"<your-ERP-username>\",\n      \"password\": \"<your-ERP-password>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\nnpm start\n```\n\nIf you want to test the used SAP Business Technology Platform - Cloud Foundry services you need also to add the VCAP\\*SERVICES variable to `default-env.json`. I.e.:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"VCAP_SERVICES\": {}\n}\n```\n\n## Run local with SAP HANA Cloud (Hybrid Testing)\n\nBefore you can run the following commands you need to connect to the BTP Cloud Foundry environment using:\n\n```\ncf login -a <CF-API-Endpoint> -o <CF-Organization> -s <CF-Space> --sso\n```\n\nThen you can create or update an existing HDI using:\n\n```\nnpm run deploy:hana\n```\n\nThis should write the needed information to `.cdsrc-private.json`. When you have deployed the application already to BTP Cloud Foundry you can run:\n\n```\ncds bind -2 bookshop-demo-db-service --for hybrid\n```\n\nto reuse the existing HDI container. Then you can use:\n\n```\nnpm run test:hana\n```\n\nto start the test or you run\n\n```\nnpm run start:hana\n```\n\nto start the app with SAP HANA Cloud as the database.\n\n## Test\n\nOpen these links in your browser:\n\n- <http://localhost:4004/webapp/fiori.html> &ndash; Fiori Launchpad sandbox\n\n## Late-Cut Microservices\n\nThe services:\n\n- JobService\n- JobExecutionService\n\nshow a concrete example of the [Late-Cut Microservices](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/providing-services#late-cut-microservices).\n\nTo get the two instances talk to each other you need to add the following entries in `default-env.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"destinations\": [\n    {\n      \"existing\": \"entries\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"job-service\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:4004\",\n      \"username\": \"job\",\n      \"password\": \"Secret1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"job-execution-service\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:4005\",\n      \"username\": \"job-execution\",\n      \"password\": \"Secret2\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Run local with sqlite\n\nTo run this example locally you can run:\n\n```\nrun-s \"deploy:sqlite:instance:**\"\n```\n\nto deploy two separate sqlite databases. You can start the two instances\n\n```\nnpm run watchboth\n```\n\n### Run hybrid with SAP HANA Cloud\n\nFirst you need to create the HDI Containers using:\n\n```\nrun-s \"deploy:hana:instance:**\"\n```\n\nDue to the issue reported at [cds deploy does not support --profile](https://answers.sap.com/questions/13754675/cds-deploy-does-not-support-profile.html) the resulting configuration isn't written to the profiles defined with --profile. So you need to add this entries manually to your `.cdsrc-private.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"requires\": {\n    \"[hybrid-instance1]\": {\n      \"db\": {\n        \"binding\": {\n          \"type\": \"cf\",\n          \"apiEndpoint\": \"<CF-API-Endpoint>\",\n          \"org\": \"<CF-Organization>\",\n          \"space\": \"<CF-Space>\",\n          \"instance\": \"bookshop-demo-db-instance1\",\n          \"key\": \"bookshop-demo-db-instance1-key\",\n          \"resolved\": false\n        },\n        \"kind\": \"hana\",\n        \"vcap\": {\n          \"name\": \"db\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"[hybrid-instance2]\": {\n      \"db\": {\n        \"binding\": {\n          \"type\": \"cf\",\n          \"apiEndpoint\": \"<CF-API-Endpoint>\",\n          \"org\": \"<CF-Organization>\",\n          \"space\": \"<CF-Space>\",\n          \"instance\": \"bookshop-demo-db-instance2\",\n          \"key\": \"bookshop-demo-db-instance2-key\",\n          \"resolved\": false\n        },\n        \"kind\": \"hana\",\n        \"vcap\": {\n          \"name\": \"db\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n```\n\nThen you can start with:\n\n```\nnpm run start:hybridboth\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nUse the REST Client scripts in `tests/job.http`.\n\n### Adding XSUAA Authentication\n\n```sh\ncf create-service xsuaa broker bookshop-demo-uaa -c xs-security.json\ncf create-service-key bookshop-demo-uaa bookshop-demo-uaa-key\ncf create-service xsuaa broker bookshop-demo-instance2-uaa -c xs-security-instance2.json\ncf create-service-key bookshop-demo-instance2-uaa bookshop-demo-instance2-uaa-key\n```\n\n```\ncds bind -2 bookshop-demo-uaa\ncds bind -2 bookshop-demo-instance2-uaa\n```\n\n## Manual steps needed for Service Broker\n\n### Generate Broker Credentials\n\n1. Navigate into folder `/broker`\n2. Run command `npm i` in terminal\n3. Run command `npm run init` in terminal\n4. Store the generated credentials in a safe place\n\n### Create `.mtaext` file\n\n1. Copy file `cf-service-broker-template.mtaext` to `cf-service-broker-private.mtaext`\n2. Copy the hashed broker credentials from your safe place into the `cf-service-broker-private.mtaext` file\n\n### Register broker\n\nBuild and deploy the MTAR as described in the next step. After the deployment you can register the broker with:\n\n```sh\ncf create-service-broker bookshop-demo-broker broker-user <plain-broker-password> <broker-url> --space-scoped\n```\n\n- The `broker-url` can be read from e.g. the SAP BTP cockpit by navigating to the broker application in the space where it was deployed.\n\n## Deploy to SAP Cloud Platform - Cloud Foundry Environment\n\nWe're using the mbt build to create a mtar that can be deployed to the SAP CP Cloud Foundry. The cf commandline must be installed and you have to be logged on to the space you want to deploy to. The build ist started with:\n\n```\nnpm run build:cf\n```\n\nthen you can deploy with:\n\n```\nnpm run deploy:cf\n```\n\nIf you need to redirect destinations according to your configuration you can achieve this by setting the environment variable `CDS_CONFIG` to this value:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"requires\": {\n    \"GWSAMPLE_BASIC\": {\n      \"credentials\": {\n        \"destination\": \"S4HANA\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"API_CV_ATTACHMENT_SRV\": {\n      \"credentials\": {\n        \"destination\": \"S4HANA\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Deploy to SAP HANA XSA on Premise\n\nWe're using the mbt build to create a mtar that can be deployed to the SAP HANA. The xs commandline must be installed and you have to be logged on to the space you want to deploy to. The build ist started with:\n\n```\nnpm run build:xsa\n```\n\nthen you can deploy with:\n\n```\nnpm run deploy:xsa\n```\n\n## Allow embedding as an iFrame\n\nManuel Seeger described the needed steps in [Can't authenticate against HTML-Mashup embedded SCP application in C4C](https://answers.sap.com/questions/13014707/cant-authenticate-against-html-mashup-embedded-scp.html). Here are the concrete steps for this application:\n\n```sh\ncf create-service xsuaa apiaccess bookshop-access\ncf create-service-key bookshop-access bookshop-access-sk\ncf service-key bookshop-access bookshop-access-sk\n```\n\nStore the returned values as Key-Value Pairs in tests/.env. I.e.:\n\n```\napiurl=\"https://api.authentication.us10.hana.ondemand.com\"\n```\n\nAlso add a variable for appurl which represents the app you want to enable to be embedded in an iFrame. Then run the REST Client Script tests/configure-xsuaa.http.\n\n## Allow API Access\n\n[Carlos Roggan](https://people.sap.com/carlos.roggan) provides a great description in his SAP Community blog post: [How to call protected app from external app as external user with scope](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/06/02/how-to-call-protected-app-from-external-app-as-external-user-with-scope/). For the moment we will not use a separate client app but a REST client script. Follow the next steps to get it working for this project. You have to create and display a service key for the client xsuaa instance:\n\n```sh\ncf create-service-key xsuaaforclient xsuaaforclient-sk\ncf service-key xsuaaforclient xsuaaforclient-sk\n```\n\nStore the returned values as Key-Value Pairs for clientid, clientsecret, url in tests/.env. as:\n\n```\nclientid=\"sb-xsappforclientapp!dsjdfs\"\nclientsecret=\"NbFeh8ibk2zQ=\"\nurl=\"https://<your-trial-account>trial.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com\"\nsrvurl=\"https://<your-trial-account>trial-dev-bookshop-demo-srv.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com\"\n```\n\nThen open the REST Client script `tests/api-access.http` in VS Code and run the script with the comment `Get Access Token (Cloud Foundry)`. It should return a valid access\\*token. Now execute the requests `Read Orders` and `Read Books`. You should see a valid result.\n\n## Authentication and Authorization\n\nThe services of this application use authentication and authorization to\nrestrict usage of the functions.  \nThe scopes of the app are defined in `xs-security.json`.\nThey are used in the services files `srv/cat-service.cds` and `srv/admin-service.cds`.\n\n_Please have a look at these files for the restrictions cause they can change due to the POC character of this project_\n\n### Authentication and Authorization in local environment\n\nIf you run the application in a local environment the users you can use are\ndefined in the field `.cdsrc`.  \nCurrently in this file the following users are defined\n\n_Please have a look at this file to see the current users and roles cause they can change due to the POC character of this project_\n\n| Username    | Scopes                       |\n| ----------- | ---------------------------- |\n| requester   | admin                        |\n| booksadmin  | booksadmin                   |\n| admin       | admin, roleadmin, booksadmin |\n| littleadmin | admin                        |\n| bob         | authenticated-user, openid   |\n"

If you want to test with PostgreSQL 11 then run:\n\n```\nnpm run docker:start:pg:11\n```\n\nNow deploy the database schema with the command:\n\n```\nnpm run deploy:pg\n```\n\nThe deploy will automatically load any data which is made available via local CSV files. If you run into any issue there make sure that no .env file is present in the root folder of this project like it would be needed if you want to run the docker image.\n\nThen open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and login by selecting System _PostgreSQL_, Server: _beershop-postgresql_, Username _postgres_ and Password _postgres_. The database _postgres_ should already exist as you've just deployed it and the tables should contain data.\n\nNow you can start the CAP application by using:\n\n```\ncds watch --profile pg\n```\n\nThen open <http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/beershop/Beers> in the browser and you should see an ODATA response with 11 beers:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"@odata.context\": \"$metadata#Beers\",\n  \"value\": [\n    {\n      \"ID\": \"b8c3fc14-22e2-4f42-837a-e6134775a186\",\n      \"name\": \"Lagerbier Hell\",\n      \"abv\": 5.2,\n      \"ibu\": 12,\n      \"brewery_ID\": \"9c937100-d459-491f-a72d-81b2929af10f\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"ID\": \"9e1704e3-6fd0-4a5d-bfb1-13ac47f7976b\",\n      \"name\": \"Schönramer Hell\",\n      \"abv\": 5,\n      \"ibu\": 20,\n      \"brewery_ID\": \"fa6b959e-3a01-40ef-872e-6030ee4de4e5\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nTo stop the docker containers run either\n\n```\nnpm run docker:stop:pg\n```\n\nor `npm run docker:stop:pg:11`.\n\n## Run on SAP Business Technology Platform - Cloud Foundry Environment with Hyperscaler Option\n\nWe're using the mbt build to create a mtar that can be deployed to the SAP CP Cloud Foundry. The build ist started with:\n\n```\nnpm run build:cf\n```\n\nlogin to Cloud Foundry with:\n\n```\ncf login --sso\n```\n\nthen you can deploy with:\n\n```\nnpm run deploy:cf\n```\n\n## Run on SAP Business Technology Platform - Cloud Foundry Environment with Service Broker\n\nUntil [SAP will provide a fully managed PostgreSQL DB](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/02/11/consuming-hyper-scaler-backing-services-on-sap-cloud-platform-an-update/) you need to provide your on PostgreSQL DB. One way is to install a [Open Service Broker](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/). The page [Compliant Service Brokers](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/compliant-service-brokers) lists brokers supporting AWS, Azure and GCP. The SAP Developers Tutorial Mission [Use Microsoft Azure Services in SAP Cloud Platform](https://developers.sap.com/mission.cp-azure-services.html) describes in great detail how to setup the Service Broker for Azure. When you finished this setup you can run:\n\n```\nnpm run create-service:pg:dbms\n```\n\nto instantiate a PostgreSQL DBMS. Then run:\n\n```\nnpm run create-service:pg:db\n```\n\nto create a the beershop database in the DBMS. With that operation done you can build the MTA by running:\n\n```\nnpm run build:cf\n```\n\nThat MTA can be deployed using:\n\n```\nnpm run deploy:cf\n```\n\nThe created database is empty. As currently no deploy script is available the needed tables and views for the CAP application need to be created before you can run the application. The easiest way to create the tables and views is to use Adminer as for the local deployment. You can get the credentials by opening the pg-beershop-srv application via the SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit. Navigate to the Service Bindings and click on \"Show sensitive data\". Enter the data in the corresponding fields of the Adminer login screen. Execute the SQL commands you find in _beershop.sql_. To fill the database with data also execute the ones in _beershop-data.sql_. Now try out the URL you find in the Overview of the pg-beershop-srv application.\n\n## Run on SAP Business Technology Platform - External PostgreSQL\n\nTo test with an external PostgreSQL created an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server. Via the Azure portal add the database beershop. Then checkout the branch `user-provided-service` and create `default-azure-ups-env.json` with the following content:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"username\": \"<your user>\",\n  \"password\": \"<your password>\",\n  \"hostname\": \"<your hostname>\",\n  \"dbname\": \"beershop\",\n  \"port\": \"5432\",\n  \"ssl\": true\n}\n\n```\n\nNow you can build and deploy as described above.\n\n## Run on SAP Business Technology Platform - Kyma Environment\n\n### Create Docker Image\n\nIf you want to build your own docker image replace _gregorwolf_ in _package.json_ and _deployment/beershop.yaml_ with your own hub.docker.com account. Then run:\n\n```\nnpm run build:docker\n```\n\nTo test the image locally you have to create a _.env_ file that provides the environment variable VCAP_SERVICES which contains the connection information. Fill it with the following content:\n\n`VCAP_SERVICES={\"docker-postgres\":[{\"name\":\"postgres\",\"label\":\"postgres\",\"tags\":[\"plain\", \"db\", \"relational\", \"database\"],\"credentials\":{\"host\":\"beershop-postgresql\",\"port\":\"5432\",\"database\":\"beershop\",\"user\":\"postgres\",\"password\":\"postgres\"}}]}`\n\nThen run:\n\n```\nnpm run docker:run:srv\n```\n\nIf you stopped this docker container you can start it again with\n\n```\nnpm run docker:start:srv\n```\n\nto start the image _gregorwolf/pg-beershop:latest_ from hub.docker.com. If you want to run your own image run che command you find in _package.json_ with your image. Finally publish the created image with:\n\n```\nnpm run push:docker\n```\n\n### Deploy to Kyma\n\nDownload the kubeconfig from your Kyma instance via the download icon in the cluster overview. Save it in _~/.kube/kubeconfig-kyma.yml_. Then run:\n\n```\nexport KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/kubeconfig-kyma.yml\n```\n\nPlease note that the token in the kubeconfig is [only valid for 8 hours](https://kyma-project.io/docs/components/security#details-iam-kubeconfig-service). So you might have to redo the download whenever you want to run the commands again.\n\nTo keep this project separate from your other deployments I would suggest to create a namespace:\n\n```\nkubectl create namespace pg-beershop\n```\n\nTo avoid `-n pg-beershop` with each kubectl command you can run:\n\n```\nkubectl config set-context --current --namespace=pg-beershop\n```\n\nDeploy the configuration:\n\n```\nkubectl -n pg-beershop apply -f deployment/beershop.yaml\n```\n\nTo create the beershop database a Job is used that starts once when you run the apply. Afterward you can delete the job with:\n\n```\nkubectl -n pg-beershop delete job beershop-db-init\n```\n\nFor troubleshooting you can SSH into the CAP container:\n\n```\nkubectl -n pg-beershop exec $(kubectl -n pg-beershop get pods -l tier=frontend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -t -i /bin/bash\n```\n\nBefore you can update the container you have to delete the beershop-db-init.\n\n```\nkubectl -n pg-beershop delete job beershop-db-init\n```\n\nThen you can run:\n\n```\nkubectl -n pg-beershop rollout restart deployment/beershop\n```\n\nIf you want to delete the deployment, then run:\n\n```\nkubectl -n pg-beershop delete -f deployment/beershop.yaml\n```\n\n## Run on Microsoft Azure\n\nInstall [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/) for your respective OS.\n\nBefore you can use the CLI you have to login:\n\n```\naz login\n```\n\nIf you have multiple account you have to list them:\n\n```\naz account list\n```\n\nand then set the one you want to use:\n\n```\naz account set --subscription <Your-Subscription-ID>\n```\n\nWith the command:\n\n```\naz account list-locations -o table\n```\n\nyou can retrieve the list of locations and select the one fitting your needs best. You can configure the default settings for location and groups:\n\n```\naz config set defaults.location=germanywestcentral defaults.group=beershop\n```\n\nTo deploy a PostgreSQL the extension db-up needs to be installed:\n\n```\naz extension add --name db-up\n```\n\nSet the environment variables:\n\n```bash\nexport postgreservername=<yourServerName>\nexport adminpassword=<yourAdminPassword>\n```\n\nThen the PostgreSQL server and database can be created:\n\n```\naz postgres up --resource-group beershop --location germanywestcentral --sku-name B_Gen5_1 --server-name $postgreservername --database-name beershop --admin-user beershop --admin-password $adminpassword --ssl-enforcement Enabled --version 11\n```\n\nIf you want to use this database from your own location or from SAP Business Technology Platform Trial in eu10 then you have to add a firewall rule. Based on the information found in [SAP Business Technology Platform Connectivity - Network](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e23f776e4d594fdbaeeb1196d47bbcc0.html#loioe23f776e4d594fdbaeeb1196d47bbcc0__trial) I add the following rule:\n\n```\naz postgres server firewall-rule create -g beershop -s $postgreservername -n cfeu10 --start-ip-address 3.122.0.0 --end-ip-address 3.124.255.255\n```\n\nStore the DB connection information in _default-env.json_. It must contain the certificate for the TLS connection documented in [Configure TLS connectivity in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Single Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/azure/postgresql/concepts-ssl-connection-security). The format must be the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"VCAP_SERVICES\": {\n    \"postgres\": [\n      {\n        \"label\": \"azure-postgresql-database\",\n        \"provider\": null,\n        \"plan\": \"database\",\n        \"name\": \"beershop-database\",\n        \"tags\": [\"PostgreSQL\"],\n        \"instance_name\": \"beershop-database\",\n        \"binding_name\": null,\n        \"credentials\": {\n          \"host\": \"<yourServerName>.postgres.database.azure.com\",\n          \"port\": 5432,\n          \"database\": \"beershop\",\n          \"password\": \"<yourAdminPassword>\",\n          \"username\": \"beershop@<yourServerName>\",\n          \"ssl\": {\n            \"rejectUnauthorized\": false,\n            \"ca\": \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----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-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n          },\n          \"sslRequired\": true,\n          \"tags\": [\"postgresql\"]\n        },\n        \"syslog_drain_url\": null,\n        \"volume_mounts\": []\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nConnect to the database as described in the last paragraph of _Run on SAP Business Technology Platform_.\n\nStore the file content in the environment variable VCAP_SERVICES (jq must be installed):\n\n```\nexport VCAP_SERVICES=\"$(cat default-env.json | jq .VCAP_SERVICES)\"\n```\n\nNow create the app service plan:\n\n```\naz appservice plan create --name beershop --resource-group beershop --sku F1 --is-linux\n```\n\nCheck out what Node.JS runtime is available:\n\n```\naz webapp list-runtimes --linux\n```\n\nThen create the web app:\n\n```\naz webapp create --resource-group beershop --plan beershop --name beershop --runtime \"NODE:16-lts\"\n```\n\nConfigure an environment variable the variable created before:\n\n```\naz webapp config appsettings set --name beershop --resource-group beershop --settings VCAP_SERVICES=\"$VCAP_SERVICES\"\n```\n\nNow you can publish the app using the Azure DevOps Pipeline.\n\nTo delete the database you can run:\n\n```\naz postgres server delete --resource-group beershop --name beershop\n```\n\nYou have to confirm the execution with _y_.\n\n## Run on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\n\nInstall [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive) for your resprective OS. Then work through the [Quickstart for Node.js in the standard environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/quickstart) to deploy\n\n```\ngcloud app create\n```\n\nStore the environment variable in _env_variables.yaml_:\n\n```YAML\nenv_variables:\n    VCAP_SERVICES: '{}'\n```\n\nThis file is included in _app.yaml_.\n\n## Use neon.tech Serverless Postgres\n\nYou can use the [neon.tech Serverless Postgres](https://neon.tech/) to run the beershop. Get the credentials after you've created a project and database. The connection information is stored in the _.cdsrc-private.json_ file:\n\n```JSON\n  \"requires\": {\n    \"[pg]\": {\n      \"db\": {\n        \"kind\": \"postgres\",\n        \"credentials\": {\n          \"host\": \"yourHost\",\n          \"port\": 5432,\n          \"user\": \"yourUser\",\n          \"password\": \"yourPassword\",\n          \"database\": \"beershop\",\n          \"ssl\": true\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n## Run on HEROKU\n\nInstall [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) for your respective OS. Then follow the instruction provided in the [Deploying with Git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) guide to deploy from this repository.\n\nYou can also create a new pipeline or application from the Heroku website and bound it to an existing git repository. This should enable you to deploy directly from your repository on every completed pull requests on the main branch.\n\n### Create a new app\n\nStart by creating a new app and remote repository on heroku by issuing this command:\n\n```\nheroku create -a pg-beershop\n```\n\n### Setup the HEROKU POSTGRES Service\n\n[Heroku Postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql) is a managed SQL database service provided directly by Heroku. You can access a Heroku Postgres database from any language with a PostgreSQL driver, including all languages officially supported by Heroku.\n\nIn order to provision your application with an Heroku Postgres db you have to run the following command from the CLI\n\n```\nheroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:<your_plan>\n```\n\nFor the first test use\n\n```\nheroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev\n```\n\nWhen correctly issued this command logs the name of the newly created db instance in the console.\n\nYou can find information about plans and pricing at [this link](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-plans).\n\nThe best way to deploy the database schema to your heroku app db is to create it locally, using the procedure provided in the local setup section of this guide, and then push it on the remote db using the following commands:\n\n```\nPGHOST=localhost PGUSER=postgres PGPASSWORD=postgres heroku pg:push beershop <remote_db_name>;\n```\n\nIn order for this method to work you need to install psql locally. You can find more informations on this topic following you'll need to setup the psql command line as stated in [this link](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#local-setup).\n\nNote that you don't need a running pgsql instance on your machine for this to work. You can use the psql client with the dockerized instance provided in this repository.\n\n### Configure app for running on Heroku\n\nThe entry point of every heroku application is the Procfile. Through this file you can specify the starting script of your application.\n\nCredentials for Heroku Postgres are periodically rotated by the system. An environment variable, called DATABASE_URL is provided to your application and is automatically updated on each credentials change. For this reason, you cannot use the static xml configuration provided in the package.json file, but you need to inject the connection string at runtime through the Procfile start command.\n\n```\nweb: export cds_requires_database_credentials_connectionString=$DATABASE_URL && cds run --profile heroku\n```\n\nWe used the [profile feature](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-env#profiles) in order to provide specific information for the heroku environment and suppress unwanted features from the package.json file (eg. xsuaa).\n\nWe also created a heroku-postbuild script to override the default build command when deployed to heroku (not required in this version).\n\n```json\n      \"database\": {\n        \"dialect\": \"plain\",\n        \"impl\": \"cds-pg\",\n        \"model\": [\n          \"srv\"\n        ],\n        \"credentials\": {\n          \"[heroku]\": {\n            \"ssl\": {\n              \"rejectUnauthorized\": false\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      },\n```\n\n```json\n    \"heroku-postbuild\": \"echo heroku postbuild skipped\"\n```\n\n### Authentication\n\nIn this example, we used a [custom handler](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/authentication#custom) to mock the user authentication in the heroku environment. You can follow the guides regarding authentication on the capire website to implement your own method, or reuse the built-in jwt or basic authentication.\n\n```javascript\n// XSUAA doesn't work in heroku environment, so you should provide your own authentication handler and strategy\n// in this example, no auth method is provided\nmodule.exports = (req, res, next) => {\n  req.user = new cds.User.Privileged();\n  return next();\n};\n```\n\n### Deploy the application\n\nTo deploy the application on heroku run the command:\n\n```\ngit push heroku main\n```\n\nYou should now be able to open the beershop example from the heroku website.\n\n### Open points\n\nRight now, due to limitations in the current cds-dbm library, is not possible to use the [heroku release phase](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/release-phase) to automatically update the database schema on release. Will fix this when the new version of the deployer library is released.\n\n## Features\n\n### Convert SQL generated from cds compile to PostgreSQL\n\nWhen you run:\n\n```\nnpm run compile:tosql\n```\n\nthe CDS model will be compiled to the _beershop-cds.sql_ file. Using the script _cdssql2pgsql.js_ this SQL is converted to support PostgreSQL. Currently only the datatype NVARCHAR must be replaced with VARCHAR.\n\n### Import CDS files from db/data into the beershop database\n\nThe path db/data is mounted to the docker container at /tmp/data. That allows to run the COPY commands generated at the end of _beershop.sql_.\n\n## Limitations\n\n### jest tests not working yet\n\nRunning the jest test with `npm test` currently fails with:\n\n```bash\n    Failed: Object {\n      \"code\": -20005,\n      \"message\": \"Failed to load DBCAPI.\",\n      \"sqlState\": \"HY000\",\n      \"stack\": \"Error: Failed to load DBCAPI.\n```\n\nwhen running the standalone script `node test/test-db.js` that uses the same way to connect everything is OK.\n\n## Ideas\n\n### Use Init Containers to deploy schema in Kyma\n\nRight now for the Kyma deployment the schema must be updated manually. [Using Liquibase in Kubernetes](https://www.liquibase.org/blog/using-liquibase-in-kubernetes) describes the use of Init Containers in K8n. I think the Docker image [timbru31/java-node:11-erbium](https://hub.docker.com/r/timbru31/java-node) should be a good basis.\n"

            "readme": "# A ChatGPT-like chat app built with SAP CAP and SAPUI5\n\nThis is a full working chat application built with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model and SAPUI5. It uses a selectable OpenAI model (including the latest ChatGPT model) of the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) to generate responses to the user's prompts. More details can be found in the related blog posts in the SAP Community:\n\n- [ChatGPT-like chat app built with SAP CAP and SAPUI5 - Part 1 – Introduction](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/22/a-chatgpt-like-chat-app-built-with-modern-sap-technologies-cap-sapui5-part-1-2/)\n- [ChatGPT-like chat app built with SAP CAP and SAPUI5 - Part 2 – Backend](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/24/a-chatgpt-like-chat-app-built-with-modern-sap-technologies-cap-sapui5-part-2-3/)\n- [ChatGPT-like chat app built with SAP CAP and SAPUI5 - Part 3 – Frontend](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/27/a-chatgpt-like-chat-app-built-with-modern-sap-technologies-cap-sapui5-part-3-3/)\n\n## Features\n\n- Chat with a selectable OpenAI model including the GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models powering [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)\n- Multi-user support for individual chats\n- Selectable and maintainable personalities for the AI chatbot\n- Chat history for each user (everything is stored in the database)\n- Per chat option to enable streaming responses from the OpenAI API\n- Code-Highlighting for code snippets in the chat messages\n- Ready to be deployed to SAP BTP Cloud Foundry\n\n### Technical Aspects\n\n- Full TypeScript implementation in backend (SAP CAP) and frontend (SAPUI5)\n- Usage of advanced TypeScript features like decorators and dependency injection in the backend\n- Chat UI built with SAPUI5 including a custom list item control and with the integration of external modules\n\n## Demo\n\nAsk the AI for help with SAPUI5:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p36-io/cap-ui5-gpt-chat/main/docs/chat_sapui5.gif \"Title\")\n\nAsk the AI about SAP BTP:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p36-io/cap-ui5-gpt-chat/main/docs/chat_btp.gif \"Title\")\n\n## Customize the app\n\nSince the app is Open Source, you can simply fork the repository and customize it to your needs.\n\nWithout a technical deep dive, there are two ways to easily customize the app:\n\n### Add a new personality\n\nThere is currently no UI to administrate personalities, but they can easily be changed in a csv file. Open the file `packages/server/db/data/p36.capui5gpt.chat-Personalities.csv` and simply add a new line with the following format:\n\n```csv\n<name>;<instruction>\n```\n\nAfter changing the file you need to redeploy the entities to the database. In the local enviroment you can do this with the following command (please note that this will delete **all data** in the local database):\n\n```bash\npnpm -r deploy:local\n```\n\nIn the Cloud Foundry environment you can simply re-deploy the app (no data will be lost).\n\n### Modify the AI model parameters\n\nIt is possible to tweak the OpenAI API parameters for the completion request. For more details, see the [OpenAI API documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create).\nSimply add the following in the `default-env.json` file in the `packages/server` folder and change the parameters to your needs:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"app_openai\": {\n    \"apiKey\": \"YOUR-API-KEY\",\n    \"completionAttributes\": {\n      \"max_tokens\": 1200,\n      \"temperature\": 0.8,\n      \"top_p\": 1,\n      \"frequency_penalty\": 0,\n      \"presence_penalty\": 0.6\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen being deployed to the Cloud Foundry environment, you can also change the parameters by changing the values in the `dev.mtaext` file.\n\n## Run the app locally in development mode\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (at least version 16)\n- [An OpenAI Account and an OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)\n- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)\n\n### Install pnpm\n\nIf you haven't `pnpm` already installed, you can globally install it via the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g pnpm\n```\n\n### Install dependencies\n\nInstall all dependencies using the following command:\n\n```bash\npnpm i\n```\n\n### Deploy the cds entities from the CAP backend to the SQLite database\n\n```bash\npnpm -r deploy:local\n```\n\n### Add your OpenAI API key\n\nPut a new file in the folder `packages/server` called `default-env.json` with the following content and add your OpenAI API key:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"app_openai\": {\n    \"apiKey\": \"YOUR-API-KEY\"\n  },\n  \"VCAP_SERVICES\": {}\n}\n```\n\n### Start the app in development mode\n\nThe following command will start the app in development mode. Server and UI will be started in parallel.\n\n```bash\npnpm --parallel start:dev\n```\n\n### Open the app in the browser\n\nOpen the following URL in your browser and start chatting: [http://localhost:8080/local.html](http://localhost:8080/local.html)\n\nYou need to login with one of the following credentials:\n\n| username    | password     |\n| ----------- | ------------ |\n| _developer_ | _helloworld_ |\n| _pirate_    | _ahoy_       |\n\nThere a no specific roles attached to either user, so feel free to choose.\n\n## Deploy the app to the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment\n\nThe project is already prepared to be deployed to the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment. The following diagram shows the architecture of the app:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p36-io/cap-ui5-gpt-chat/main/docs/diagram.jpg \"Title\")\n\nThe full application can be deployed to SAP BTP without any cost, using a Trial or Free Tier acccount.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- You have an OpenAI Account and requested an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)\n- You have a SAP BTP Trial [SAP BTP Trial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) or [Free Tier Account](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-free-tier-account.html)\n- You have created an [SAP HANA Cloud Service instance](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-app-hana-cloud-setup.html#08480ec0-ac70-4d47-a759-dc5cb0eb1d58)\n- You have installed the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html)\n- You have installed the [MultiApps CF CLI Plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin)\n\n### Add your OpenAI API key\n\nEdit the file `dev.mtaext` and add your OpenAI API key to the `app_openai` property:\n\n```yaml\nmodules:\n  - name: capui5gptchat-srv\n    properties:\n      app_openai: >\n        {\n          \"apiKey\": \"YOUR-API-KEY\",\n          \"completionAttributes\": {\n            \"max_tokens\": 1200,\n            \"temperature\": 0.8,\n            \"top_p\": 1,\n            \"frequency_penalty\": 0,\n            \"presence_penalty\": 0.6\n          }\n        }\n```\n\n### Login to the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment\n\n```bash\ncf login\n```\n\n### Deploy the MTA\n\nAll parts of the application can be deployed with a single command:\n\n```yaml\npnpm deploy:dev\n```\n\nThe `mta.yaml` file contains all relevant services and modules:\n\n- The `capui5gptchat-router` module for a standalone approuter\n- The `capui5gptchat-server` module including the CAP backend\n- The `capui5gptchat-ui` module including the SAPUI5 frontend\n\nThe app will be accessible via managed approuter as well as via the standalone approuter.\n\n### Assign the required role to your user\n\nThe deployment will create a Role Collection `ChatGPT-like App Human` in your Cloud Foundry environment. You need to assign the role to your user in order to be able to login to the app.\n\n## How to obtain Support\n\nThis content is provided \"as-is\" without warranties or conditions of any kind.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 p36 GmbH.
